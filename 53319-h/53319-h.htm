<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The Great War imposed on speculative biology a moratorium as
in the long vaca­tion of lawyers, in which are causes left over to
the next term. And so the old case Lamarck <i>versus</i> Weismann
was not heard in the Courts of Science during the war. In the
present term it is due to be heard afresh, and at some future date
to come up for settlement. The chapters that follow comprise
some of the pleadings on behalf of the plaintiff and are part of the
brief of a junior counsel. This adjective, alas! signifies not the
years—for such are often old enough to be the fathers of the leaders—but
the standing and attainments of a junior. But in the open
Court of Science, and on suited occasions, it may be the business
of a junior to question, in the interests of his client, the authority
even of Attorneys-General and Lords Chief Justice. In matters
of thought and inquiry it is useless to retreat within a stronghold
and bar the gates. It may be satisfactory to himself for one
Milner to write a book on behalf of a certain body of doctrine and
call it <i>The End of Controversy</i>, but the book should have held the
sub-title <i>The End of Progress</i>. The Newtons, Pasteurs and
Darwins have seldom wielded the weapon of controversy, though
the triumph of <i>The Origin of Species</i> would have been slower
without the aid of Darwin’s brilliant champion and candid friend.
But, if the leaders seldom need such help, for the Gibeonite it is a
matter of course and simple necessity. With all the urbanity
due to the great subject-matter should this pleasant duty be
performed. Who would not prefer to the fierce Spaniard the genial
Portuguese, discussing all subjects without rancour, and lover of
bull-fights though he be, taking care to wrap in cork the horns of
his fighting bulls?</p>

<p>The earlier chapters treat of the arrangement of the mammalian
hair, which has occupied my attention for over twenty<span class="pagenum" title="vi"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
years, and this has led straight to the other subjects, because of
their bearing on Lamarckism and Initiative in Evolution. The
tentative conclusions reached years ago have been strengthened by
further knowledge and reflec­tion, and perhaps by certain criticisms.
The furrow ploughed may have been lonely, but the pursuit has
not been without the mild pleasure of seeing fresh scattered portions
of the field coming into their natural order. The resulting state of
mind resembles that of a certain Mr. Burke recorded in the annals
of a golf club, second to none, the Ancient, and now Royal Blackheath,
among whose minutes appears the <span class="nowrap">following:—</span></p>

<div class="ml2em">
<p class="ml2em">“20th September, 1834.</p>

<p>Present, Mr. Burke, <i>Solus</i>.</p>

<p class="ml4em">The dinner was good, wine abundant, and the utmost
harmony prevailed. The want of grouse was severely
felt this day.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is written on page 101 of the <i>Chronicles of Blackheath Golfers</i>.</p>

<p>My debt to such writings as those of Professors Arthur Keith,
Woods Jones, Graham Kerr, and Professors Sherrington, Starling,
Schäfer, McDougall and Ward is too obvious to the reader to need
more than a bare mention.</p>

<p>I have to thank one critic, Miss Inez Whipple, now Mrs. H.
Wilder Harris, for her able if hostile criticism of two former books
of mine which has been of use in this one; and Mr. R.&nbsp;E. Holding
for good help extending over many years in the prepara­tion of the
illustrations, and for many a good sugges­tion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

FROM KNOWN TO UNKNOWN</h2>


<p>Upward—still upward—still upward to the highest! Such is
the claim of modern man for the story of himself and the lower
inhabitants of the globe. The zoologists have gone so far as to
confer upon him the surname Sapiens—Homo Sapiens. Learned
indeed he is, and heir of all the ages, but whether or not his assumed
surname be warranted the doctrine of descent with modifica­tion
can never again be questioned. The work of Darwin was crowned
when he compelled a general acceptance of that doctrine, and now
the Descent of Man and the Ascent of Man are equivalent terms
for a natural process which has converted man from a thing to a
person, and is the founda­tion of all modern thought. The biologist
works secure in the knowledge that he is studying some portion
of a chain of life stretching back for incalculable ages, and is not
careful to produce those missing links demanded by the once
formidable foes of his fundamental principle. Haeckel may
announce that Pithecanthropus Erectus of Dubois is truly a
Pliocene remainder of that famous group of highest Catarrhines
which were the immediate pithecoid ancestors of man. This may
or may not be true, but if true it makes the descent of man from
a lower stock none the surer, the increasing verifica­tion of which
is not found to rest on missing links.</p>

<p>Many of the discoveries of modern science are made by
proceeding from known phenomena to the unknown, or, more
precisely, from the well-known through the little-known
to the hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>As to the validity of knowledge it is enough to say this—and
pass on—<i>all our knowledge is provisional and imperfect, and much
of our ignorance is as transient as ourselves</i>.</p>

<p>There are two chief ways in which historians deal with their
subject-matter, though the moderns combine them. When oral
tradition gives place to written records the lineal descendant of
the bards and annalists collects his scanty authorities and compiles
his story from them from beginning to end. The Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle of Bede and Alfred, the Book of Howth, the works of
Giraldus Cambrensis, the Chronicles of Froissart and the Memoirs<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
of de Comines were composed in the only way that was then possible.
But the muse of history entered on a deeper and more fruitful
course when about ninety years ago the study of documents became
an essential feature of historical work. It was then that the
historian grew up, entered upon his finest inheritance and assumed
his Greek title, Enquirer, Student of facts, Man of research. He
is now nothing if not a man of science as well as of letters. With
a wealth of documents within his reach so great that the 3239
Vatican cases full of them formed by no means the richest collec­tion
in the archives of Europe, he proceeds to read backwards correctly
what many an earlier annalist read forwards falsely. “We are
still at the beginning of the documentary age which is destined to
make history independent of historians, to develop learning at the
expense of writing, and to accomplish a revolu­tion in other sciences
as well.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>


<h3>The Historian a Biologist.</h3>

<p>It is not too much to say that he who studies history, national,
political, constitutional, ecclesiastical, military or economic is as
much a biologist in the widest sense as the botanist and zoologist.
Indeed these were till recently termed students of natural <i>history</i>,
until the advance of knowledge gave us the various special groups
of workers, conveniently called biologists. Though the study of
human history by documents is an essential part of the historical
method and the student may read <i>his</i> subject backwards, this would
not of itself warrant the technical biologist in doing so, even though
he be a child of Nature and part of her—“Nature’s insurgent son.”
But some reflec­tion on the facts of certain provinces of science
affords ample justifica­tion for the method. It is chiefly in questions
of origin that it avails, while it fails in that form of research by
experiment which is the glory of modern science. A few examples
of the process of passing from the known to the unknown will
illustrate the method.</p>


<h3>Darwin.</h3>

<p>Much of the <i>Origin of Species</i> and all of the <i>Descent of Man</i>
was founded on this method; thus in the former the conceptions
of struggle took their main rise from the work of Malthus on Human
Popula­tion, and of variation from domesticated animals and plants,
and this is true also of Wallace. A mere glance at the divisions of
<i>The Descent of Man</i> shows that it could never have been attempted
in any other than the backward way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span></p>


<h3>Geology.</h3>

<p>In their researches on the crust of the earth Playfair, Hutton
and Lyell did not pursue them by going down a coal mine till they
came to the lowest available beds and work upward from these
to the highest. Though for purposes of exposi­tion a great geologist,
as Sir Archibald Geikie, may expound the making of the earth
from the lowest to the highest levels, and Professor Bonney tell
us the <i>Story of our Planet</i> from beginning to end as if he had watched
it unfolding, Lyell in his <i>Principles of Geology</i> shows how the
studies of his great province began. There we have the backward
reading of its story pursued by himself and other great ones, and
where it led them. Commencing with the Pleistocene period
and passing through Neocene and Eocene periods through the
Mesozoic Era and its cretaceous, jurassic and triassic systems to the
Newer Palæozoic Era and its Permian, carboniferous, and Devonian
systems, the older Palæozoic Era and its Silurian Ordovician and
Cambrian systems, he reaches the unknown. But before all this
patient research and its record is reached he treats, as he must, of
consolida­tion and altera­tion of strata, of petrifica­tion of organic
remains, elevation of strata, horizontal and inclined stratifica­tion,
of faulting, denuda­tion, upheaval and subsidence as they combine
to remodel the earth’s crust. The title of his classical work is
significant—<i>An Attempt to Explain the Former Changes of the
Earth’s Surface by Reference to Causes now in Operation</i> (it
may be noted that in 1830 they were fond of capital letters and
of underlining their words). If these great men had been condemned
to the sole use of the method of the annalist in his treatment
of human history, that of the coal mine in geology, this great
province of knowledge would never have been what it is to-day.</p>

<p>At this point I think it well to state that this illuminating
principle of Lyell is pursued in nearly all the matters of fact and
their interpreta­tion contained in the following chapters, so that
from time to time I shall have to employ the verb, coined for the
purpose, when I attempt to “Lyell” them on behalf of Lamarck.</p>


<h3>Anthropology.</h3>

<p>The anthropologist could hardly make a start with his research,
if, knowing nothing of his own anatomy, physiology, customs and
beliefs, he tried to interpret the physical features, habits, manners,
customs and rites of an African tribe. Without such prior knowledge
he would find it a profitless task to journey to the banks of
the Zambesi and bring back any intelligible history of the aborigines.
If he did not know the games of a European child how could he<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
understand the variants of them such as the writer of <i>Savage</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>Childhood</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
expounds so well?</p>


<h3>The Sources of Rivers.</h3>

<p>To trace the course and source of a river is a simple task through
the work of modern geographers, and such a pursuit illustrates
well the two methods here considered, but it is doubtful if any river
was ever traced originally from its fountain head to its mouth. The
backward way of such explora­tion, from the nature of the case,
has always been taken, and men have traced the more or less finished
products of the lower stretches, backward, still backwards, even
as in the Indus, to the still-unknown. The earliest thinkers and
seekers in the plains of Bengal were familiar with much of their
great sacred and composite river as it flowed into its delta. Slowly,
laboriously, here a little and there a little, they learned its stupendous
story. They found the plateau of Tibet in the Himalayas where
the twin-sisters, Brahmaputra and Ganges were born, and saw how
from the one high cradle they parted on their eastward course
for a thousand miles with the mountain-chain between them, and
how, coming together again, the one descending through Assam
and the other flowing through the plains, reinforced by the Jumna,
they united to form the Ganges-Brahmaputra. A great subject
indeed for the early geographer, but one which he could only follow
in the backward way. Again how well known and revered in
Egypt was the Nile for thousands of years before its source in
Victoria Nyanza could be traced, even though Nero might send
his explorers as far as the marshes of the White Nile, and Ptolemy’s
search for it might lead him to guess the riddle, and assign it to
two great lakes!</p>


<h3>Genealogy.</h3>

<p>Not many of us can trace our ancestry in the direct male line
to the 8th century by authentic and written documents as did a
Hebrew friend of mine, thus effectually meeting the doubts of a
prospective brother-in-law who asked him as to his fitness to enter
a family which was able to produce a stray peer of the realm in its
roll. On the other hand a man who has lost his parents in childhood
may know nothing of them but that his father’s name was A. Mann,
and that he was buried in a Kentish churchyard. He may go on a
pilgrimage and find there recorded the fact that A. Mann was the
son of A. Mann, Gent, who came from Northumberland. He will
doubtless make another pilgrimage and find there a large vault,<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
and over it an imposing record of many a Mann, and yet further
he may go, and from the Heralds’ College find out the still earlier
deriva­tion of his ancestors.</p>


<h3>Detection of a Crime.</h3>

<p>There are two chief ways of detecting a crime. By oral evidence
from eye-witnesses or confession of the accused you may get direct
proof, though even here are pitfalls from careless and hasty witnesses
on the one hand, or on the other from a strange perversion of mind
of the confessing person which is well enough known to forensic
medicine. You may thus bring home to the accused his guilt by
the method of the annalist. Or you may employ the more common
method of studying circumstantial evidence; the story of the crime
is read backwards and a verdict of guilty is given. This is the
main stuff of which the prevalent detective story is composed.</p>


<h3>A Parable.</h3>

<p>A plain parable may well conclude this chapter.</p>

<p>As I mused on the chain of life I found a piece of whipcord
which had been lying by for twenty-five years since some of it was
used for rigging a model yacht, and this very efficient product of
human art seemed to speak to me on the subject of my musings.
Perhaps if Huxley could extract from a piece of chalk or lumps of
coal two magnificent expositions on geology and biology, this little
trifle of cord might afford a text on a way of looking at living things
which should be useful in this old case of Lamarck <i>v.</i> Weismann—and
others.</p>

<p>Should I learn the story of the whipcord forwards like an annalist,
or backward like a modern historian? Clearly it could be done
in a measure by either method. Here was a highly finished product
of which either might furnish the story, and of which, we may suppose,
I knew nothing. I tried the backward way, and by the aid of a
needle began to unravel it. The cord was as good as if just made,
slender, strong, twisted, with some glazing on the twisted threads.
It showed three main bundles, and each of these was composed of
two smaller ones. The substance of all these six was found when
examined with a lens to consist of minute silky fibres varying
from a quarter of an inch to an inch in length. This was all I could
learn without a stronger magnifying power or a chemical analysis,
and the direct search was at an end. I gathered since then that
the first three bundles were called “strands,” and the two composing
each of these “yarns,” and that the fibres were from a plant called
hemp. This did not carry the story deep or far, and illustrates<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
how often in the backward method facts have to be supplemented
by inference. But I had learnt some undoubted facts and some
inferences from them nearly as certain. Some mind of man had
conceived and hands carried out the division of the bundles of
fibres into three strands, had twisted them somehow so as to reduce
their length by a quarter and yet not far enough to rupture them,
and had thus fitted them the better for their purpose by a reinforcement
of tensile strength due to the twisting. I could also see
that this same mind had seen it better to divide each of these
strands into two yarns before the final twisting, and that in framing
the yarns the silky fibres of the plant had been squeezed together
by some powerful agency and yet not disintegrated, and that the
finished product had been immersed in a protective substance
which gave it a slight glaze. In short, I, though a child in these
matters, read much of the story of this cord in terms of mind dealing
with given organic matter. I may add that I did not imagine
myself a little Paley, and that I do not intend to “take in” the
reader as to the argument from design and final causes, even though
this parable may feebly resemble Paley’s study of a watch. The
conclusion was perfectly clear that certain directing grey cells of
a certain brain had interfered with and acted upon some plastic
vegetable matter, and one could at the “strand” stage, the “yarn”
stage, and the “fibre” stage see mind writ large.</p>


<h3>The Forward Way.</h3>

<p>The limits of the former method are obvious, but I might also
attempt to follow the little story as a crime is followed and described
by eye-witnesses. So I go to an old-fashioned rope-factory and
ask the foreman questions about the making of twine, cords, ropes
and cables. He shows me bundles of hemp; he calls them Russian,
Italian or American, and goes on to tell me how the fibre is
“heckled” or combed, how “tow” is separated from “line,” and
how the yarns are pressed together and twisted, how they are at
first rough and bristly, and are then dressed, polished, and “sized”
with such a starch as that of the potato. When I proceed to ask
him about the plant itself his interest flags, and he becomes vague.
He says, “You had better ask the Head, young Mr. X., he knows
these things better.” I find the Head with his golf clubs over his
shoulder and about to start on his “business,” and he is polite, but
says he knows very little about the origin of his hemp. “You should
go over the way and ask Messrs. Y. if they will let you see the expert
who advises them in their business, he will know.” The expert is
at home and kindly and fully describes to me the early home of<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
the wild <i>Cannabis Sativa</i> in a moderate climate of Asia, the rich
soil it needs for its growth and the various countries of the world
into which it has been introduced; and the bast-fibres of the bark
of this plant which from remote antiquity has supplied the silky
stuff. He then tells me how the stems are dried and crushed, and
then of the important stage of fermenta­tion or “retting” in water,
how they are again beaten in a “break,” then rubbed and “scutched,”
and finally “heckled” or combed; and, as to analytic chemistry,
he tells me that the chief constituent is cellulose. This quest is
now over and I know much I could not find out by the backward
method, though the dependence of its rival upon the presence of
honest and capable eye-witnesses is not less obvious. It is not alone
in ecclesiastical history that cheats and forgers of documents exist.
In the world of Nature there may be, for all we know, biological
False Decretals that may lead us far astray, such perhaps as
Amphioxous and Archæopteryx, and the Pseudo-Isidore who
produced them may yet be discovered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

REVIEW OF THE POSITION</h2>


<p>The modern story of the theory of organic evolution shows certain
important dates—1859, 1880, 1894, 1895, 1899 and 1909. These
begin with the <i>Origin of Species</i> and end with the publica­tion of a
volume in commemora­tion of its jubilee, when most of the leading
students of evolution united to render homage to Darwin. The
year 1859 has been so often and so worthily treated that it is enough
here to say that the fifty years between the issue of the work of
Darwin and Wallace and 1909 saw a greater revolu­tion in biology,
speculative and practical, than any period so relatively brief had
ever seen.</p>

<p>In the year 1880 the “coming of age” of the <i>Origin of Species</i>
was celebrated. On the 9th of April at the Royal Institu­tion an
address was given by the powerful friend, champion and candid
critic of Darwin, and before the scientific and educated world
Huxley was able to say with his own force and directness: “Evolution
is no longer an hypothesis, but an historical fact.” It may
be noted in passing that Darwin’s theory of natural selection is not
referred to in the address. Challenges and opposi­tion from various
quarters met this confident claim of the formidable speaker, as
doubtless he desired, but the work of the succeeding half-century
has done little or nothing that does not establish that claim. It
is hardly to be doubted that if in the jubilee-year, 1909, Huxley had
been alive on this earth, instead of elsewhere, his eloquent voice
would have been heard to declare with emphasis equal to that
of 1880: “Selection is no longer an hypothesis, but an historical
fact.” Some such statement, with the <i>imprimatur</i> of a great name
would have removed from the jubilee-volume that slight aspect
as of a Dutch <span class="nowrap">chorus<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> which is apparent in it. A remark of Kelvi<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>n’s
when he was conferring a medal of the Royal Society on Huxley
may illustrate what has been said above. He said that they must
all be thankful to have still among them that champion of Evolution
who once bore down its enemies, but was now possibly needed to
save it from its friends. It may be regretted that it was not so
in 1909.</p>

<p>Considering the mole-like and persistent work of the biometricians, some
who are at present keeping well-ordered lawns may find some day a few
disturbing heaps of facts. I am reminded here of an historic duel, Oxford <i>v.</i>
Cambridge, which took place soon after the introduc­tion of Mendel’s discoveries
into England at the London Zoological Society, when Prof. Bateson
expounded them with enthusiasm and when Weldon repelled them with
cogent and incisive arguments. The duel lasted nearly two hours and that
was not too long for the audience, but one has the impression that some of
what Professor Thomson calls muddleheadedness must have been somewhere
existing. However, the duel was fought when Mendelism was young.</p>


<h3>Three Blows to Darwin.</h3>

<p>But other historic events are more relevant to my immediate
purpose than these.</p>

<p>Three blows were delivered against Darwinism in the years
1894, 1895 and 1899 by Prof. Bateson, Weismann, and again Prof.
Bateson, under which it seemed to reel, but from which it is more
than likely it has derived but greater strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bateson.</span></h3>

<p>In 1894 Prof. Bateson published his large and important work,
<i>Materials for the Study of Variation</i>. As a distinguished student
and teacher of biology he found the received doctrine of evolution
in straits as regards the factor of natural selection in producing
specific differences, as indeed happened to another equally eminent
man during the next year. He was profoundly discontented as
to the origin of specific differences on the theory of direct utility
of variations, and he said “on our present knowledge the matter is
talked out.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> He threw over the study of adapta­tion “as a means
of directly solving the problem of species.” He came to the conclusion
“Variation is Evolution,” and affirmed that the readiest
way of solving the problem of evolution is to study the facts of
variation. Hence arose this notable book, and hence one of his
trenchant statements to the effect “that the existence of new
forms having from their beginning more or less of the kind of perfec­tion
that we associate with normality, is a fact that once and for
all disposes of the attempt to interpret all perfec­tion and definiteness
of form as the work of selection,<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> and “Inquiry into the causes
of variation is as yet, in my judgment, premature.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> It will
hardly be denied that a work which contained such statements as
these from such a source seemed momentous in its influence on the
fate of Darwin’s theory. Prof. Bateson yielded to none in his loyalty
to Darwin, as far as he knew himself, and here he is as candid as
Huxley, and he declares that in his treatment of the phenomena
of variation is found nothing which is in any way opposed to Darwin’s
theory. The shade of Darwin might nevertheless have looked
with some misgiving at this man over against him with a drawn
sword in his hand, and have asked gently, “Art thou for us or for
our adversaries?” Prof. Bateson’s work chiefly requires to be
considered here because to any reader of it there must come the
convic­tion on the one hand of Prof. Bateson’s merits and power, and
on the other of his limita­tion as a student of organic evolution.
In 1894 is evident already an exclusive attention to structure
rather than function, to anatomy than physiology; the anatomical
leaven in doctrine has leavened the whole lump. For him physiology
of animals and plants does not exist, or at the best is the
outcome of structures which arise through variation and selection.
This, if I may say so, is as much his strength as his weakness.
There have been other great biologists, such as Geoffrey Saint-<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>Hilaire
and Richard Owen, of whom this is true. If that were all
one would not wish the reader to be troubled with any criticism
of one’s betters, indeed such remarks as are here made do not
amount to criticism at all, but just plain text-book statements.
It is also evident that the outlook of Prof. Bateson was being prepared
for a revela­tion which had not yet come, in which he took a
prominent, if not dominant part, I mean the great rediscovery of
Mendel’s work by de Vries, Correns and Tschermak and himself in
England. His keen and close attention to anatomical structures
was preparing his mind for the germinal conceptions of unit-characters,
dominance and segrega­tion. The intensive cultiva­tion
of the fertile field of genetics proceeded apace, and Prof. Bateson
in his contribu­tion to the jubilee-volume of 1909 betrayed the
trend of his devotion to a system of <i>distribu­tion</i> rather than formation
of the qualities of an organism. The organism as an historical
functioning, striving being, had receded once for all from his vision.
He hazarded the sugges­tion in <i>Heredity and Variation in Modern
Lights</i> that “variation consists largely in the unpacking and repacking
of an original complexity,” and that “it is not so certain
as we might like to think that the order of these events is not predetermined.”
Incidentally one may remark that, <i>malgré lui</i>, Prof.
Bateson stands forth as a modern Paley as does Weismann in his
great rival and opposing scheme. It is true that he says “I see
no ground whatever for holding such a view, but in fairness the
possibility should not be forgotten and in the light of modern
research it scarcely looks so absurdly improbable as before.”
Having drawn the sword he threw away the scabbard in 1914 when
he occupied the presidential chair of the British Associa­tion of
Science at Melbourne and Sydney. He had said in 1894 in his
book on variation as stated before, “Inquiry into the causes of
variation is as yet, in my opinion, premature,” and then in 1914
at Melbourne, after twenty more years of study of the subject in
the Mendelian direction, “It is likely that the occurrence of these
variations is wholly irregular, and as to their causation <i>we are
absolutely without surmise or even plausible specula­tion</i>.” (my italics)<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span>
So, on this fundamental point, he stands where he did when he
began the study of variation, but apart from this point he again
threw out his sugges­tion of 1909 as to the unpacking and repacking
of an original complexity. At Melbourne he said, “Lotsy has
lately with great courage suggested to us that all variation may be
due to such crossing. I do not disguise my sympathy with this
effort.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> <i>All variation!</i> He said later, “In spite of seeming per<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>versity,
therefore, we have to admit that there is no evolutionary
change which in the present state of our knowledge we can positively
declare <i>not due to loss</i>.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> (Italics mine.) These two statements of
1914 are enough to show that the biologist of 1894, 1899, 1909 and
1914 has evolved in a definite line, and it is to his honour that he
has remembered “to thine ownself be true.” But he is not so true
to himself in his scorn of those who propound theories. For myself
I would give little for the biologist who did not hold or propound
some theory. What was the penultimate and stirring message of
the gifted G.&nbsp;B. Howes? “We live by ideas, we advance by a
knowledge of the facts.” The self-denying ordinance affirmed and
reaffirmed by Prof. Bateson is not observed even in the Melbourne
and Sydney addresses. In the former, he says “at first it may
seem rank absurdity to suppose that the primordial form or forms
of protoplasm could have contained complexity enough to produce
the divers types of life,” and asks us to open our minds to this
possibility. Again “I have confidence that the artistic gifts of
mankind will prove to be due not to something added to the makeup
of an ordinary man, but to the absence of factors which in the
normal person inhibit the development of these gifts.” And at Sydney,
“Ages before written history began, in some unknown
place, plants, or more likely a plant of wheat lost the dominant
factor to which this brittleness is due, and the recessive thrashable
wheat resulted. Some man noticed this wonderful novelty, and
it has been disseminated over the earth. The original variation
may well have occurred once only in a single germ,” and “so must
it have been with man.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span></p>

<p>These are three stupendous stretches of imagina­tion and theory
in one address, which would have been the poorer if they had not
overcome the accomplished speaker’s dislike of the theories—of
others. If they are not ideal constructions of a high order I do not
know the meaning of that term. They are worthy of Weismann
the Prince of ideal constructionists. Prof. Bateson might indeed be
another Newton with his <i>Hypotheses non fingo</i>.</p>

<p>Turning to another important biological doctrine one can see
what it may be legitimate to call a bi-phyletic parallelism in the
biological make-up of Prof. Bateson. Again is seen consistency of
view and loyalty to his first love. Two references from these
addresses will be enough to introduce the point.</p>

<p>At Melbourne, “We thus reach the essential principle that
an organism cannot pass on to offspring a factor which it did not
itself receive in fertiliza­tion.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span></p>
<p>At Sydney, “The factors which the individual receives from
his parents, and no others, are those which he can transmit to his
offspring<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>—in other words the doctrine of the inheritance of
acquired characters is estopped. As to this he speaks in 1909
more doubtfully on p.&nbsp;90 and on p.&nbsp;95 almost dogmatically<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> There
is just a convenient haziness of meaning in the term “factor”
with which some play might be made, but, taking it to mean what
the context indicates, an acquirement made by the individual
during its personal life, we have pretty clear evidence that Prof.
Bateson will have nothing to do with the inheritance of acquired
characters as that doctrine is understood by the unsophisticated
biologist. This opposi­tion should be counted unto him for righteousness
rather than the reverse, for it falls into line with his life’s work
to which he has given of his best.—<i>Vestigia nulla retrorsum.</i> The
point reached here which concerns my purpose is that the orthodox
Mendelian still knows nothing of the cause or origin of variation,
and will have none of Lamarck.</p>

<p>This considera­tion of Prof. Bateson’s work of a quarter of a
century has been necessary for showing how the work of Weismann
and himself diverge gravely and yet meet at one point, and the
year 1899, being linked with 1894, has been taken out of its chronological
order.</p>

<p>It may be permitted perhaps to say respectfully to the
Mendelians in the words of the dying father in the fable, “Dig,
my sons, dig in the vineyard.” If they follow still the course of the
sons they may find more gold than they have found already and
perchance that which is better than gold. But they will produce
from it nothing that is not there.</p>


<h3>Two Parables.</h3>

<p>Here gentle reader (I seem to remember this style of address
in the stories of our youth) pause with me in a little oasis of the
desert-stage of our journey, and brush off some of the dust, while I
briefly narrate two incidents, but I pray you also not to leave me
in the midst of them so that you may escape the next short stage.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A traveller, small and insignificant, armed only with an
oak cudgel, was passing alone through a South American
forest. As he trudged forward he noticed at a certain point
in the path (shall we call it 1894–1899?) that a jaguar was
watching him and was about to break his truce with man. He
turned off to the right and there he saw a puma and this too<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
seemed to meditate evil. He hastened forward just in time
as his two enemies sprang at him, and these two near relatives
were locked in mortal grip—and so he passed on safe!</p></div>

<p>The reader, naturalist or layman, can point the moral for
himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the battle of Trafalgar, while fighting was in full progress
on one of the ships, some sailors were occupied in throwing
overboard the bodies of those who had been killed. A poor
Scotchman badly wounded and hardly conscious was taken
up by two seamen, an Englishman and an Irishman, and as
they were about to throw him overboard his feeble voice was
heard to say “I’m no deed yet.” “What’s that?” said the
Irishman. “I’m no deed yet”; “Arrah, the doctor said
he was dead, over wid him,” said the Irishman.</p></div>


<h3>Weismann.</h3>

<p>During the period 1894–1899 there was a dramatic proclama­tion
on the part of one of the greatest living biologists, which was,
in the cosmos of biology, what the Proclama­tion of the Empress-Queen
of India was in 1876, and it is not out of place to remind the
reader that the fates of the two Imperial utterances have been
somewhat different. In 1895 Weismann issued his official statement
of doctrine which was to crown the work of his life, an essay
on Germinal Selection. From Freyburg in November, 1895, he wrote
a preface to his address delivered on September 16th in that year
to the International Congress of Zoologists at Leyden. This formed
an epoch in biological thought and there lived none so well qualified
as Weismann to stand forth as its interpreter. The well-translated,
forcible language, and lucid thought leave the reader in no manner
of doubt as to his meaning. It took a wider form in his final book
on the Evolution Theory, but the germinal and essential thoughts
of the latter were contained in the former. From 1895 onwards
the praise of Weismann was in all the churches. Probably no
modern worker in the fields of heredity and evolution has done
so much as Weismann towards raising great issues and removing
some ancient misconceptions; but it is one thing to raise great
issues and another to solve them. In this he has signally failed,
nevertheless biological theory would be the poorer if he had not
made the attempt. Reflec­tion, the work of other biologists, and
the remorseless hand of time have shaken the edifices then raised.
I will here only bring forward a few of the most illuminating passages
of the 1895 essay, and then refer to the handling of Weismann’s
work by Romanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span></p>

<p>This trenchant essay contains fifty-seven pages, of which
reasoning forms the greater part. As to the facts it might well
pass for an essay from Professor Poulton’s pen, for Weismann’s
special province of insects occupies nearly all the evidence from
facts. Outside this highly specialised group there are exactly
fifty-three lines, or one and a half pages, which deal with other
animal groups, and there are four casual allusions to plants occupying
twelve lines in all! In the essay of 1909 on the Selection Theory
this treatment of animated life in the world is improved upon
and thirteen out of its forty-seven pages refer to animals outside
his favourite group of insects. Such exclusive dealing with these
little things does not commend the reasoning, at any rate to a neo-Lamarckian;
such a circle is too select for him.</p>


<h3>Weismann’s Twelve Points.</h3>

<p>The most striking remarks from the 1895 essay on germinal
selection <span class="nowrap">are:—</span></p>

<p>1. “The real aim of the present essay is to rehabilitate the
principle of selection. If I should succeed in reinstating this
principle in its imperilled rights, it would be a source of extreme
satisfac­tion to me.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p>2. Speaking of the whole theory of selection he claimed to
have found a position “which is necessary to protect it against the
many doubts which gathered around it on all sides like so many
lowering thunder-clouds.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> And he speaks on page&nbsp;26 of “the
flood of objections against the theory of selection touching its
inability to modify many parts at once.”</p>

<p>Thus Weismann stood forth to defend the crumbling edifice
of Darwinism and threw his shining sword into the scales, a scientific
Athanasius “contending for our all.” Again is seen a friend of
Darwin from another camp than that of Mendel, whose support
needs to be received with some caution. <i>Toujours en vedette</i> is
a useful rule.</p>

<p>3. Speaking of adaptedness in animated nature he says,
“We know of only one natural principle of explana­tion for this
fact—that of selection.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<p>4. “Germinal selection is the last consequence of the applica­tion
of the principle of Malthus to living nature.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span></p>

<p>5. “Without doubt the theory (Germinal Selection) requires
that the initial steps of a variation should also have selective
value.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span></p>
<p>6. “Something is still wanting in the theory of Darwin and
Wallace which it is obligatory on us to discover if we possibly can.
We must seek to discover why it happens that useful variations are
always present.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>7. “It is impossible to do without the assump­tion that the
useful variations are always present, or that <i>they always exist in
a sufficiently large number of individuals for the selective process</i>.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>8. “<i>Some profound connexions must exist between the utility
of a variation and its actual appearance, or the direction of the variation
of a part must be determined by utility.</i><span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span></p>

<p>9. That “germinal selection performs the same services for
the understanding of observed transformations . . . that a heredity
of acquired characters would perform without rendering necessary
so <i>violent an assump­tion</i>!<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> (Italics mine.)</p>

<p>10. Weismann speaks warmly of Professor Lloyd Morgan for
his caution and calmness of judgment but complains of him that
he “has not been able to abandon completely the heredity of
acquired characters.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>

<p>11. As to passive effects of environment, etc., he says “the
Lamarckian principle is here excluded <i>ab initio</i>.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span></p>

<p>12. “It seems to me that a hypothesis of this kind
(Lamarckism) has performed its services and must be discarded the
moment it is found to be at hopeless variance with the facts.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span></p>

<p>I have only to add here that several years ago I wrote to
Weismann drawing his attention to some facts I had observed which
seemed to me to be instances of use-inheritance, and I received
a reply in polite but brief and Prussian terms to the effect that the
facts referred to must be capable of some other interpreta­tion, for
<i>the machinery for their transmission did not exist</i>.</p>

<p>Each of these twelve quotations from Weismann’s essay is
important from the present point of view, and shows how far
neo-Darwinians are likely to promote the greater glory of Darwin,
and though more than a quarter of a century elapsed between this
essay and his death Weismann was not the man to have repudiated
any of these strong statements.</p>


<h3>Lighthouse Value.</h3>

<p>I hope at this point a small digression is not out of place in
order to introduce an aspect of Weismann’s work which is not
usually appreciated. A child is aware of the great and lesser lights
that rule the day and night, but for modern man these are not<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
sufficient. Accordingly he has invented from immemorial times
his oil lamps, rushlights, tallow and wax candles, gas and electric
light for the illumina­tion of his streets and houses. Prehistoric
man did not seem to need them, as he thought. These useful
examples of applied knowledge were obviously brought into use
for showing man better where he was going and where to go, what
he was doing and what he wished to see. I hope this trite remark
may be pardoned, for there is another form of light which suits my
purpose of illustrating the aspect of Weismannism referred to above,
that is the light of a lighthouse. The ancients in their crude way
saw the need for this and as far back as the days of Ptolemy II. a
tower to give light was erected on the island of Pharus, off the
Egyptian coast, and it was called a <i>pharos</i>. Man found it necessary,
as naviga­tion and seafaring advanced, to use this principle more
and more, and on headland, sandbank and rugged coast has built
noble structures to aid the sailor in his dangerous course. The
oldest and finest of these in Great Britain is the Eddystone lighthouse,
built first in 1695 by Winstanley and finally by Smeaton
in 1756–9. For what reason is a lighthouse built and placed where
it is? For the precisely opposite reason to that of the domestic
candle. While this shows you where to go and how better to do
your immediate business, a lighthouse is for the main purpose of
showing a mariner where he should <i>not go</i>. It has no relation to
adornment or pleasure. It does not invite you to come in your
vessel and admire it. It tells you to go away and avoid the sunken
rock or treacherous sands.</p>

<p>I submit here the sugges­tion with all deference, that the final
work of Weismann has lighthouse value of a high order, as to the
<i>modus operandi</i> of evolution. His greatness as a biologist, his
candour and skill in dialectics, have built up a veritable lighthouse
which may usefully warn the seeker after the path of evolution that
he must turn elsewhere if he would not founder upon a reef of facts.</p>

<p>The two great contributions to evolutionary thought that
Weismann has made should be considered separately, the theory
of germ-plasm and that of evolution, though the latter seems to
be the necessary outcome of the former. But the truth of Weismann’s
view of heredity does not of necessity require the error of
his theory of evolution.</p>


<h3>Romanes on Weismann.</h3>

<p>For this study the examina­tion of Weismannism by Romanes
published in 1893 is of great value. I need only refer here to the
main conclusions of that lucid and learned examina­tion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

<p>Weismann’s work on the germ-plasm in pursuance of a theory
of heredity is pronounced by Romanes to have remained up to
1893 substantially unaltered, though largely added to in matters of
detail, and at the present time as far as I gather from a study of
the more recent literature this theory holds the field or at least a
commanding position in it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> Originally he held that the germ-plasm
possessed <i>perpetual</i> continuity since the first origin of life,
and <i>absolute</i> stability since the first origin of sexual propaga­tion,
but he has shown himself willing to surrender the first postulate,
and has himself altered the second. As it stands now it must be
admitted that the continuity of the germ-plasm is an interrupted
continuity with the appearance of every inherited change; the
continuity is theoretical, not actual, and the stability of the germ-plasm
is not absolute but of a high degree. We can thus see in the
story of this original theory of heredity the lighthouse value of the
<i>pharos</i> of Ptolemy II.</p>

<p>It is far otherwise with Weismann’s theory of evolution.
Romanes shows that with the removal of its essential postulate
the absolute stability of germ-plasm, Weismann’s theory of evolution
falls to the ground. He has indeed surrendered much in his
later building, his second temple of Solomon, and prominent among
these was the claim that the only causes of individual variation<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
and of the origin of species in the uni-cellular organisms are the
Lamarckian factors, just as in the multicellular <i>the only cause of
these is natural selection</i>. Thus we see standing at the critical date,
1892, the first Eddystone lighthouse of Winstanley, a greater and
more important structure than the old pharos.</p>


<h3>Germinal Selection.</h3>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that one of the “thunderclouds”
threatening Darwinism, of which Weismann spoke in 1895, was
this examina­tion of Weismannism by Romanes. As the case stood
then some fresh strategy was needed if victory for Darwin was to
be won, at least so the great leader said. It must be remembered
that it was the <i>personal</i> selection of Darwin which was held to be
in danger. Accordingly germinal selection was brought forth and
remained the basis of Weismann’s later <i>Evolution Theory</i> of
1904 and 1909. Romanes did not live to see or assist in the disproof
of this ambitious piece of work so that his “examina­tion” is so far
incomplete.</p>

<p>The position of germinal selection is defined in Weismann’s
statement that “it is the adaptive requirement itself that produces
the useful direction of variation by means of selectional processes
within the germ.” Here it is in a nutshell. The theory itself
is consistent, and clearness has been added to the earlier evolution
theory by the claim that a struggle for nutriment occurs within
the fertilised ovum between the innumerable determinants of the
different parts, so that maintenance or victory over weaker determinants
takes place. Thus we have a survival of the fittest <i>in petto</i>
in the germ analogous to that of the individual organisms as we see
them. There is of course a resemblance here to the cellular or
histonal selection of Roux, but his doctrines are not weighted with
the intolerable dogma of the non-inheritance of acquired characters.
But ultimately this concep­tion of germinal selection has to come
down and bow to the tribunal of facts, and the remark of Weismann
on Lamarckism which has been already quoted, “It seems to me
that an hypothesis of this kind has performed its service and must
be discarded the moment it is found to be at hopeless variance with
the facts,” confronts the consistent Weismannian. And I venture
to say here that germinal selection is represented by the Eddystone
lighthouse of 1756–9 erected by Smeaton.</p>

<p>The grounds for this statement are afforded by numerous facts
and experiments, to which in the later chapters I propose to add a
few fresh ones, and by a growing body of opinion and authority
in favour of Lamarckian factors in evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span></p>

<p>Three “lighthouses” of this metaphorical sort have thus
been afforded by the work of Weismann, represented by the Pharos
of old, Winstanley’s Eddystone lighthouse and that of Smeaton.</p>


<h3>Authority.</h3>

<p>We have then Weismann and Professor Bateson definitely
ranged against the position taken in this volume as to a cause or
origin or variation and the inheritance of acquired characters.
To these we must add the great weight of Sir E. Ray Lankester’s
opinion lately given in a reply to Professor Adami that “it is very
widely admitted (more correctly “claimed”) that no case of the
transmission of what are called acquired characters from parent
to offspring has been demonstrated in so far as those higher animals
and plants which multiply by means of specialised egg-cells and
sperm-cells are concerned.”</p>

<p>It is not necessary to mention more than these “three
mighties” of the biological world.</p>

<p>Many others such as Prof. J. Arthur Thomson and Prof. W.&nbsp;K.
Brooks, of Johns Hopkins University, are still unconvinced as to
Lamarckian factors and ask for more evidence, and they have many
to support them in their opinion and claim. There is often a tone
of weariness, as well as wariness in their remarks on the matter.</p>

<p>In favour of the neo-Lamarckian position, with which stands
or falls the suggested cause of variation, there is a growing body
of opinion, with the mention of which I conclude this review.</p>

<p>1. The accomplished writer of <i>Form and Function</i>, Mr. E.
S. Russell, says the theory of Lamarck “although it had little
influence upon biological thought during and for a long time after
the lifetime of its author, <i>is still at the present day a living and
developing doctrine</i>.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span></p>

<p>2. Sir Francis Darwin from the Presidential Chair of
the British Associa­tion of Science in Dublin in 1908 proclaimed
his adherence to the mnemonic theory of heredity, foreshadowed by
Samuel Butler and inaugurated by Semon, a condition of which is
that acquired characters are inherited. This caused much stir
in the camp of “our friends the enemy.”</p>

<p>3. Observations and experiments at variance with germinal
selection and its negative presupposi­tion have been rapidly
accumulated from the work of botanists and zoologists who were
prepared to appeal to the tribunal of natural processes; though
Weismann and some of his followers, with some reason, look upon
the evidence from plants as a weak link in the chain of evidence.<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
Many of the observations and experiments are well-known and only
a mere mention of them need be made here, they are such as Mr.
J.&nbsp;T. Cunningham’s observations on the effect of light on the under
surface of flounders, Kammerer’s on the changes in the colour of
salamanders to surrounding objects, and others by him on certain
amphibia and reptiles especially <i>alytes</i> held by Professor McBride
to be convincing, though the latter are to be repeated at the London
Zoological Society’s gardens and are therefore <i>sub judice</i>—others
on brine-shrimps, on the effects of change of food on bee-grubs
and tadpoles, and of the change of level of environments of certain
cereals—others by Henslow on plants which have never been refuted,
and many by the late Prince Kropotkin. The latter have appeared
at length in certain issues of the Nineteenth Century in September
1901, March 1912, October 1914, and the last in January 1919, and
they deal both with plants and animals, and are too numerous to
be mentioned here individually.</p>

<p>Again, Professor Dendy as President of the Zoological Section
of the British Associa­tion of Science in September, 1914, devoted
most of his address to the subject of Lamarckism and firmly claimed
as a necessary factor of evolution “the direct response of the
organism to environmental stimuli at all stages of development,
whereby individual adapta­tion is secured, and this individual
adapta­tion must arise again and again in each succeeding genera­tion.”
He also maintains this position in several passages in his
important work <i>Outlines of Evolutionary Biology</i> published in 1912.</p>

<p>A statement by Professor Bower, President of the Botanical
section of the British Associa­tion of Science in 1914 should also
be noted: “I share it (the doctrine in question) in whole or
in part with many botanists, with men who have lived their lives
in the atmosphere of observa­tion and experiment found in large
botanical gardens and not least with a former President of the
British Associa­tion, viz., Sir Francis Darwin.”</p>

<p>Professor Adami, in 1917, published an original work called
<i>Medical Contributions to the Study of Evolution</i> in which from
his extensive knowledge of the subject he deals with evidence of
inheritance of acquired characters in lowly organisms as well as
higher animals from the point of view of pathology.</p>

<p>Enough has been stated here to show that the dogma of
Weismann or Lamarckian factors in organic evolution, <i>quâ</i> authority,
has been in poor case during recent years, and it remains for me now
to add my small quota of the authority of facts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

THE PROBLEMS PRESENTED.</h2>


<p>In his classical work on Heredity, Professor J. Arthur Thomson
exhausts the evidence on Lamarckism available then (1908) in
a manner worthy of the summing-up of an English judge. This
is presented to the jury of the biological world and they are still
considering it. Their verdict and his sentence are not yet delivered,
and it may be they will still be long delayed. One might almost
use the words of Professor Bateson, previously quoted, “on our
present knowledge the matter is talked out.”</p>

<p>I will make one prophecy in this volume and predict that the
fourth edition of this work in 1930 will contain the verdict of the
jury and sentence of the distinguished judge to the effect that in
the case Lamarck <i>v.</i> Weismann the plaintiff has won. As in the
Great War the Old Contemptibles held their line with the utmost
difficulty against the disciplined hosts of the greatest army ever
known till then, and yet the latter found their First Battle of the
Marne, so perchance it may be in the present struggle.</p>

<p>I introduce this chapter with an important passage from the
above work on the <i>Logical position of the Argument</i>, in which
the two possible methods of establishing the affirmative position
of Lamarck are given; these are, first, actual experimental proof
of transmission, and, second, a collec­tion of facts which cannot
be interpreted without the hypothesis of modifica­tion inheritance.
The words are<span class="nowrap">:<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> “<i>The neo-Lamarckians have to show that the phenomena
they adduce as illustrations of modifica­tion-inheritance cannot
be interpreted as the results of selection operating on germinal variations.
In order to do this to the satisfac­tion of the other side, the neo-Lamarckians
must prove that the characters in question are outside
the scope of natural selection, that they are non-utilitarian and not
correlated with any useful characters—a manifestly difficult task.
The neo-Darwinians, on the other hand, have to prove that the phenomena
in question cannot be the results of modifica­tion-inheritance.
And this is in most cases impossible.</i><span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span></p>

<p>I have placed this passage in italics because of its importance
from the point of view of the two problems which I am presenting
and would remark here that if only all the writers had used
Professor Thomson’s term “modifications” instead of “characters”
in the statement of this doctrine much confusion and evasion of
plain facts would have been avoided, and yet such workers as the
Mendelians, if deprived of their clear-cut term “characters”
would have been less able to carry on their studies. To this point
of terminology I refer below<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span></p>

<p>In a world teeming with the life of plants and animals, and
in the branch of science which seeks to interpret them, where we
enter upon the unknown much sooner than in any other sphere
of science, Weismann has set out to prove or maintain the most
stupendous negative ever framed by the human mind. It would
require generations of men to <i>prove</i> this negative, if it were probable,
and his case rests mainly on the assumed weakness of his opponents.
So what is needed and demanded from the neo-Lamarckians is the
produc­tion of a few well-attested and verified facts, and, as he
admits himself, then it must follow as the night the day that his
followers will surrender his characteristic dogma. The more
cautious leaders and teachers of the day say that this has not taken
place and ask for facts, more facts and still more facts, and this
attitude is both judicious and judicial, for example in a teacher so
eminent as Professor J. Arthur Thomson. Scientific men, in such
a position as he occupies with grace and distinc­tion, owe a serious
debt of loyalty to ultimate truth and to the inquiring minds of the
young students of to-day and to-morrow. Those who are in a
position of inferior responsibility and honour, and more freedom,
just rank and file members of the Commons’ House of Parliament,
may be pardoned if they do not exhibit an excess of deference to
authority and if they think for themselves.</p>


<h3>Two Questions.</h3>

<p>There are before the Scientific jury to-day two very vivid
questions.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(1) Can modifications in the structure of an individual organism,
occurring as a result of its experience, be transmitted?</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(2) What is the cause of variation?</p>

<p>If, as Weismann taught, the answer to No. 1 is in the negative,
there is little use here in trying to answer No. 2, for from the present
point of view the two stand or fall together in the study of Initiative
in Evolution. Such <i>distributional</i> answers to No. 2 as Bateson and
de Vries may offer do not concern my purpose.</p>

<p>If No. 1 be answered in the affirmative it is sufficient for the
purpose of treating initial variations from the Lamarckian standpoint,
for it is hardly conceivable that Nature would neglect so
simple and obvious a method of leading upwards and onwards the
organisms that inhabit a changing world.</p>

<p>It is very clear from what is written on the subject of evolution
to-day that a <i>point d’appui</i> in the process is earnestly desired by
many workers and that Weismann’s dogma stops the way. A very
significant and important remark is made by Professor W. McDougall<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
in his small book on Physiological Psychology, with reference to the
inheritance of acquired characters, that it is a “proposi­tion which
most biologists at the present time are inclined to deny because
they cannot conceive how such transmission can be effected.
Nevertheless the rejection of this view leaves us with insuperable
difficulties when we attempt to account for the evolution of the
nervous system, and there are no established facts with which it is
incompatible.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> I am aware that in the scheme of observed
nature there is evidence of no iron necessity, that the convenience
of psychologists should be provided for, and they, like others of us,
have to do the best they can with the tools and the materials which
exist, and I agree with Professor Thomson in his remark on <i>Misunderstanding
No. 1</i>, “that our first business is to find out the facts
of the case, careless whether it makes our interpreta­tion of the
history of life more or less difficult,<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> but I am persuaded that he
will not treat lightly <i>such</i> a statement, from <i>such</i> a source, on <i>such</i>
a subject as that I have quoted from Professor McDougall. As
to his second statement on the same page “that in the supply of
terminal <i>variations</i>, whose transmissibility is unquestioned, there is
ample raw material for evolution” it is important as an opinion,
and no more, and there is in the present connec­tion, an elusiveness
about it which prevents one allowing it to pass. It should be noted
that stress is laid upon the term “variations” and from the context
this means congenital full-blown “characters” such as those that
Weismann says are provided in the germ guided by selection. At
any rate, initial modifications are not signified by Professor Thomson’s
remark. So for <i>evolution</i> of forms of life it is possible the
assertion may be true, but apart from distribu­tion of variations,
under the process called amphimixis, some starting point is required
for the initial and wholly useless stages of many variations. These
may or may not become “characters” or adaptive.</p>


<h3>What the Problems are not.</h3>

<p>The ground may be cleared here by saying what our problems
are not. There is no question as to whether Lamarckism or
Darwinism represents the predominant partner in the story of life;
there is no question of the “relative importance of natural selection
and the Lamarckian factors in organic evolution,” though such a
question may arise when once Lamarckism has received its passport
from the authorities; but the time is not yet. Nor is it a question
as to the reason why adaptive modifications are so constantly<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
present in the germ. It is not a question of Nature <i>or</i> Nurture, but
perhaps may be found to be a study of Nature <i>and</i> Nurture. It is
not a question of Mendelian analysis, nor as to the distribu­tion
of either mutations on the one hand, nor of minute fluctuating
variations on the other. The problems are therefore limited
in scope and ambition, and are none the worse for that, as being
better open to correc­tion or support.</p>


<h3>The Problems Considered.</h3>

<p>It seems but natural to most persons who contemplate with
any care the ever-changing and progressive drama of life in plants
and animals that unquestionably the <i>dramatis personæ</i> by their
individual response to the environments and exercise of their
functions must contribute a share, however small, to their offspring.
When first this view presents itself to their minds they resent as
“unnatural” any other possibility. But, alas! they find that
such a conclusion is not permitted in those regions where alone
the white light of science shines. Here the writ of <i>a priori</i> does
not run. The spirit of inquiry makes its challenge to every presupposi­tion
and every assertion in its province—even those of
current science. I have shown that this particular assump­tion of
the natural man was firmly challenged by Weismann, who was not
the first, but the greatest, biologist to teach that modifications are
not transmitted. Accordingly, agreeable and convenient as it
would be to assume the Lamarckian hypothesis as a working one,
it needs in the present day to be supported by evidence before this
can be allowed. Facts, then, against Weismann’s dogma are
demanded and of such a kind as will satisfy so powerful an advocate
of his own views. In passing it may be remarked again that there
is nothing so misleading as facts, except statistics, and for both
sides to bear in mind the warning of a French writer that in such
inquiries as this we should be careful lest we find the facts for
which we are looking.</p>

<p>To meet the conditions laid down in Professor Thomson’s
Canon I propose to describe certain phenomena which are adduced
as instances of modifications in certain mammals whose structure
and mode of life are intimately known, and whose ancestry is little
in dispute<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> The most convincing of these lines of evidence are
those which are shown to be outside the range of any form of
selection, as well as the <i>distributional</i> factors of Mendel and<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
de Vries. It is well to enumerate here the six different factors in
organic evolution which might claim a share in the produc­tion of
such humble phenomena as form the subject-matter of this volume—they
are:</p>

<p class="ml2em">
1. Personal Selection of Darwin.<br />
2. Sexual Selection.<br />
3. Histonal or Cellular Selection of Roux.<br />
4. Germinal Selection.<br />
5. Inheritance according to Mendelian principles.<br />
6. Inheritance of Mutations.
</p>

<p>There is a somewhat severe and ill-defined condition attached
to the formula in question for it demands that such modifications
as will satisfy the neo-Darwinians shall not be <i>correlated with
any useful character</i><span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> If such a <i>conditio sine quâ non</i> were taken
too literally it would at once foreclose the case as to the possibility
of transmission of modifications at all, the questions of issue ought
in that case never to have been raised—and, <i>cadit quæstio</i>. This
cannot be the intention of the biologist who propounds the formula.
It could not reasonably be carried so far as to insist that a modifica­tion
arising from a certain habit, active or passive, in an animal,
and which on that account, and on paper, may loosely be said to be
‘correlated’ with it, is to be ruled out. That would be tantamount
to saying for example, that, because an animal must lie down in a
certain attitude when it rests, or walk or run in a certain manner,
in other words that it is useful to exist, certain modifications claimed
to be due to these fundamental parts of existence must be excluded
from the inquiry. The neo-Darwinian is not a critic easy to be
entreated, but <i>that</i> he would not claim. Let me take one example
of what I mean. A short-haired dog will spend a considerable
part of its daily life, and presumably a long line of ancestors did
so too, lying with its forelegs planted in front of its chest and its
head either raised in the air when awake or resting on the upper
surface of the forelegs (of course the familiar attitude of a dog with
its body and head curled up and fore-legs doubled is not referred
to here). If the hairy coat be examined over its neck and jaw,
which lie in this attitude, on and against the forelegs, a remarkable
reversal of the direction of the hairs is found and the outline of
this forms an accurate mould of the surface applied to the forelegs.
This is transmitted of course from previous generations of domestic
dogs. A precisely analogous reversal of the hairs is found on the
under or extensor surfaces of the forelegs, matching with wonderful<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
exactness the area of pressure of these on the ground, and anyone
can see it who has a canine friend of the fox-terrier type. Long-haired
dogs display it less neatly outlined. An instance such as
this cannot be excluded from the evidence forthcoming because
it is correlated with the useful “character” of lying in a certain
attitude. Such a phenomenon, many similar to which will be
seen later, had at any rate an origin <i>de novo</i> at <i>some time</i> in the
ancestral stock, and in <i>some way</i>. To discover these is part of my
business. The boldest neo-Darwinian will not claim that this
arrangement of a dog’s hair arose by selectional processes within
the germ either in the initial or completed stages.</p>


<h3>Correlation.</h3>

<p>The term “correla­tion” is somewhat scornfully said by
Weismann to be “unquestionably a fine word,” and it has indeed
in biological writings a very varied set of meanings. I will not
vex the reader with a reference to our old friend Mesopotamia,
but mention what Dr. Vernon in <i>Variation in Animals and Plants</i>
says of the term, referring to the relation between stature and
head-index in man: “Such a statement must vary according to
the notion of the observer as to what does and what does not constitute
correla­tion.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> The most approved and precise meaning
of the loose term in question is that associated with the work of
the biometricians, and a few examples from Dr. Vernon’s book
will show how far this concep­tion of correla­tion is removed from
the literal applica­tion of Professor Thomson’s formula. Dr. Vernon
treats of such phenomena as the correla­tion of the long heads of
greyhounds with length of legs, contrasting them with the shortened
heads and legs of bull-dogs. He describes also the correla­tion in
man between the stature and length of forearm from elbow to tip
of middle finger, correlated measurements of crabs, of external
structures of prawns, the tufts of Polish fowls correlated with
perforations in the skull, also certain constitutional peculiarities
with colour of skin. These few cases are enough to give an idea
of the more precise and fairer accepta­tion of the term, but while
these form a useful subject for minute study it may be remarked
that they agree also with Lamarckian factors as to their origin and
development. They are much more in line with Darwin’s use of
the word and are strangely reminiscent of the well-known example
of the Irish elk with its great head and horns which was brought
forward in favour of Lamarckism by Herbert Spencer. They<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
breathe an atmosphere of physiology rather than anatomy, or
function than form.</p>

<p>Enough has been said here by way of defining the terms of
the issue. The negative we have to sustain is that the following
facts and observations declare that certain small modifications
cannot be governed by selection and are not correlated with useful
characters. It will be shown later that Professor Thomson’s
stringent condition is not in all of them compiled with, but that,
in spite of this, the probability of their being valid examples of
Lamarckism in practice is immense.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

INITIAL VARIATIONS AND TOTAL EXPERIENCE.</h2>


<p>The present chapter is on <i>a priori</i> lines and will perhaps be dismissed
with a wave of the hand or hurriedly skimmed over, but I pray the
reader at least to read the two or three last pages of it. It is at
any rate suggestive, and perhaps I may anticipate the comments
of the neo-Darwinian and throw myself on his mercy by mentioning
a remark of the late Sir Andrew Clark, prince of physicians and
genial cynic, which he made to a patient in my presence. A lady
not distinguished for depth of thought asked him a rather silly
question in medicine. As if offended he drew himself up, holding
in his hand a cup of tea which he was enjoying, and replied at once
“Madam, you must get a younger and more inexperienced man
than I am to answer you that question.”</p>

<p>A very high degree of probability may be attached to the
presupposi­tion that Lamarckian factors, even in their humblest
form, may enter into the story of the organisms as historical and
living beings. Every hypothesis in matters of science, or, to put
it at its lowest, every scientific guess must transcend the evidence
at the time available.</p>


<h3>Total Experience.</h3>

<p>The sugges­tion I venture to make here is that if we take a
comprehensive view of certain two great groups of phenomena
in nature, which may be termed universal in their extent, it is difficult
to conceive that they are not causally connected in the sense that
one is the universal antecedent of the other. On the one hand
are found universal minute differences, not only between any pair
of organisms, but of any two corresponding parts of any organism,
even to the size and shape of each leaf on each plant. On the
other is universal discontinuity of <i>total experience</i> of all organisms.
This term includes all the stimuli of use and environment to which
an organism is exposed throughout its whole existence, and its
response to them. It includes the whole succession of active and
passive stimuli which begin with the formation of a zygote in higher
forms, for example, and continue till the death or end of reproductive
life of the individual. It stands for such stimuli as arise from<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
<i>habitat</i> on or in the earth, in various levels of salt or fresh water,
in sea, lake, pool and river, and in the branches of trees, from
<i>climate</i>, from degrees of <i>light</i>, <i>temperature</i>, <i>moisture</i> and <i>wind</i>, from
presence and activity of <i>enemies</i> and <i>rivals</i>, from <i>supplies of food</i>,
from <i>geographical</i> and <i>topographical</i> position. Such an enumera­tion
of stimuli might be much extended if it would serve any purpose.
But it is enough to say that the number of such stimuli, and the
varying degrees in which these are received and responded to,
have hardly any limit which we can conceive. It is a very different
and harder task to find out the propor­tion in which such stimuli
are advantageous, injurious or indifferent to the organisms, but
it may be taken as certain that the vast majority are indifferent
in the sense of producing structural change, and, that the advantageous
stimuli transmit structural effects to offspring, is only a
matter of very strong probability. If the above two groups of
phenomena are not causally connected they are intertwined with
remarkable closeness and perversity. This aspect of the “web
of life” has received attention, and deserves more.</p>


<h3>Discontinuous Environments.</h3>

<p>Some reference must be made here to observations of Prof.
Bateson in his work on variation. In the first place he makes a
most valuable statement that “<i>the environment as the directing
cause is essential to Lamarck’s theory and as the limiting cause is
essential to the doctrine of Natural Selection</i><span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> (which I venture
to place in italics on account of its importance to all who seek the
pathway of organic evolution) and points out also that “diversity
of environment is thus the measure of diversity of specific form.
Here then we meet the difficulty that diverse environments often
shade into each other insensibly and form a continuous series.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
This is clearly true and important to the subjects he is discussing.
But in regard to the concep­tion with which I am here concerned,
that of <i>total experience</i> of organisms, it must be remembered that
there is no such thing as an environment apart from the living
beings that it environs, and that from this point of view there is
no such thing in the world of nature as a continuous environment.
The environment of two amœbæ living under a cover-glass is,
for them, far from continuous. In their infinitesimal existence the
exact position they occupy in the environing drop of fluid, in which
the propor­tion of their humble fare at one side of the cover-glass<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
is not the same as that on the opposite side, renders their environments
discontinuous, or different from that of another amœba
occupying a position and “environment” which <i>we</i> should consider
identical. And this considera­tion applies to the other few
“tropisms” which enter into their little lives. This statement
may be difficult to prove, but it is a necessity of thought. An
illustra­tion may assist one in visualizing such discontinuity. A
fly is seen crawling at its own pace up one of the great pillars of
St. Paul’s Cathedral. It comes to one of the thin layers of cement
worn down with age and so delicate that a man can just see it in
a good light. The fly pauses, and passes into what is for it a chasm,
with as much relative delibera­tion as the man would show in
passing across a deep railway cutting. The number of pictures
that could be made of cases corresponding to that of the amœba is
incalculable. A few will suffice. Two plants of the common nettle
are growing on the south side of a ditch in a lane, one rooted a foot
higher than the other. The upper one receives throughout its
life from wind and sun stimuli slightly different from those received
by the lower, and from the soil slightly less moisture. These
again receive stimuli very different from another pair on the northern
side of the lane. Again in windy weather a clump of sycamores
facing the south-west in England, and situated on the ridge of an
eminence, will receive very different stimuli from a similar clump
on the north-eastern slope of this eminence, and will demonstrate
the fact, as to force of wind, by a marked slope to the North East.
Even in either of the clumps the individual trees present varying
degrees of slope according to their position. The total experience
of these two clumps of sycamores and of any two in each clump
is obviously different. In a windy situation you can tell in July
which is the prevailing wind by noting the main inclina­tion of the
ears of corn in a field. Again two male sticklebacks in a pond will
make nests for the eggs, there to be deposited, and one will choose
a spot on the southern and another on the northern side of a little
promontory of soil and stones at the edge of the pond. One will
find ready for him materials for building his nest different from
those of his rival, and he and his wife and family will receive for
that season very different stimuli, and so will the stimuli differ
in other phases of their existence in a pond occupying a few square
yards. On a sandy bank in a garden facing south you may discover
two little caves ingeniously hidden by a small opening, and in each
of them you can see a toad. Though these are only a few feet
apart one is more widely open to sun and wind than the other and
one deeper than the other, and whatever the other activities of the<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
two toads may be in their little shelters, they receive stimuli different
in strength and number. On another bank in the same garden
less exposed to view, and altogether more sheltered from sun and
wind and enemies, a robin has built a well-hidden nest. If the six
fledglings in the nest are watched when the mother is absent they
are seen to occupy very different positions of comfort, pressure and
warmth. When the mother-bird returns from marketing she is
hardly impartial in the amount of food she puts into their open
beaks. But the slight and perhaps unimportant inequality of
their experiences as fledglings is nothing to that which follows when
they fly abroad, and which continues to the end of their lives, the
life of a robin being somewhere about ten years long. The differences
of the <i>total experience</i> of the six young robins is easy to picture.
Again, surely, the total experience of two fleas on the body of one
plague-rat must be for such small creatures of importance to their
welfare, according as their respective “pitches” are on the abdomen,
back or legs of the host. When the life-history of a human being
is told in full the discontinuity of his total experience needs no
proof. The proof is written large before our eyes. But, perhaps,
one example may be given. There are two very eminent living
writers, whose light has certainly for some years not been hidden
under a bushel, Mr. Chesterton and Mr. George Bernard Shaw. We
may be said to know them well. Leaving out of sight the Celtic
strain claimed by one, and indeed all inherited differences, we see
two men of perhaps equal ability, near of an age, both living in
London, both living by their pen, both in easy circumstances.
When one considers for a moment the different company these two
men keep, their different and opposing outlook on life, their different
and opposing forms of diet for their minds and bodies (I know which
of the two diets of those men I would choose and with which of
them I would prefer to be cast on a desert island) one can only say
that the total experience of Mr. Chesterton differs from that of
Mr. Shaw as cheese from chalk, which things, incidentally, are an
allegory in the philosophy of life.</p>

<p>The thought here briefly expressed falls well into line with
Prof. Bateson’s statement that the directing cause of the environment
is essential to the theory of Lamarck, and I do not hesitate to add
to it the assertion that <i>all environment</i>, in the wide sense of total
experience, <i>is discontinuous</i>. There are no such phenomena in
total experience as unit-characters of allied forms, small variations
are the rule. Without doubt a large propor­tion of the stimuli
received by an organism are as figures written on a slate and at once
wiped off. They are as the snows of yester year. The most they<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
do is to contribute in their measure to the metabolism of the
organism, being too numerous and minute to affect any structural
change. In a higher form of life none but those which are frequently
repeated in the individual and in succeeding generations
can effect any structural response.</p>


<h3>Mould and Sieve.</h3>

<p>It will be remembered that a single example was given of a
short-haired dog in which its common habit of lying was associated
with a certain pattern of hair. This introduces and illustrates
the very wide concep­tion of a moulding process undergone by an
organism. It is one familiar to biologists and very much so to
Professor Thomson in his various writings. Not less is he an
exponent of the metaphorical work of the sieve of natural selection.
I therefore claim nothing new when, with the temerity of certain
persons treading where others are said to fear to do so, I invent
an inclusive term and propose to call the two fundamental factors
of organic evolution <span class="nowrap"><i>Plasto-diēthēsis</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> in which the conceptions
of mould and sieve are included and hyphenated. This word is
no more proposed for its elegance than are <i>panmixia</i>, <i>amphimixis</i>
and <i>tetraplasty</i>, though perhaps it may be the etymological
superior of one or more of these. It is at any rate inclusive and
perhaps sufficiently audacious to assure the inventor of the title
of Dr. Pangloss of controversial memory. But as hard words
break no bones I have taken this risk and it would appear to be a
convenient “conceptual counter” and even Professor Karl Pearson
could not consistently forbid it. It has at any rate the merit of
having a meaning clear to all friends and opponents alike of
Lamarckism. It will be observed that the two words are placed in
what I take to be their natural order as expressive of the Alpha
and Omega of the story of organic evolution. The moulding
process is claimed to precede that of the sieve, as physiology
precedes anatomy and function structure, in that form of biological
specula­tion which is held here to be the soundest<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span></p>

<p>So the banns between Lamarck and Darwin are published,
not for the first time of asking, and who shall say that there is
cause or just impediment why these two should not be joined
together in holy matrimony?</p>

<p>I conclude this chapter with a passage from the life of Columbus
by Washington Irving which affords a fitting parallel from history
in the higher development and union of two formerly hostile
Kingdoms, and the moral of it is clear and simple. But as a
forensic junior I beg to enter a <i>caveat</i> to the effect that though the
name of Columbus occurs no sugges­tion is made of the discovery
of a New World.</p>

<p>“It has been well observed of Ferdinand and Isabella that
they lived together not like man and wife whose estates are in
common, under the orders of the husband, but like two monarchs
strictly allied. They had separate claims to sovereignty in
virtue of their separate Kingdoms, and held separate councils.
Yet they were so happily united by common views, common
interests, and a great deference for each other, that this double
administra­tion never prevented a unity of purpose and action.
All acts of sovereignty were executed in both their names; all
public writings subscribed with both their signatures; their
likenesses were stamped together on the public coin, and the
royal seal displayed the united arms of Castile and Aragon.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

METHOD OF PROOF.</h2>


<p>In a matter of scientific inquiry one cannot go far wrong if one
follows the advice of Henri Poincaré, who lays down certain principles
of method; four of these are the <span class="nowrap">following:—</span></p>

<p class="pl5hi">(1) The most interesting facts are those which can be used
several times, those which have a chance of recurring.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(2) The facts which have a chance of recurring are simple facts.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(3) Method is the selection of facts, and accordingly our first
care must be to devise a method.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(4) We should look for the cases in which the rule established
stands the best chance of being found fault with.</p>

<p>The groups of facts described in the succeeding chapters are
in agreement with these principles in the main, and are perhaps
like a dust heap for their intrinsic value. But one knows that
before now among a good deal of <i>débris</i> a rusty key has been found
which has opened a cabinet containing certain treasures, and in
the hands of someone else than the finder has produced useful
results.</p>

<p>The headings of the chapters describe the facts, and there is no
need to enumerate them here. The first and largest group is studied
according to a method which is in a measure applied to all the
others. Most of them are external or superficial phenomena and
accordingly are open to others beside the expert for observa­tion and
corrobora­tion, or the reverse. The typical plan adopted is as
follows: a large number of related phenomena are chosen, and
the more prominent of these are observed and described. Keeping
in mind the two plain issues laid down, the origin of initial modifications
and their transmission, I have selected the facts because,
especially such as those of the hair, they are very simple, of wide
distribu­tion in animals well known to us, such as the domestic horse
and man, and none are brought forward which any other observer
cannot study for himself if he has some anatomical and physiological
knowledge, some training and care in recording observations. In
most centres of popula­tion there are still left a good supply of
horses in streets and stables, of preserved specimens in museums
and living ones in zoological gardens, and of hairy young men who<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
will hardly refuse a polite request to examine the minute hairs
clothing their trunks and limbs. One has to pursue a certain
amount of that study which may be called the sister of plant-ecology,
that is, animal-ecology or the behaviour of animals at
home. The student of these matters, it may be freely admitted,
will complain, unless he has some hypothesis or line of thought to
follow, that he has been set down in a valley in which the bones are
very many and very dry. But, armed or primed with an hypothesis,
he may find an affirmative answer to his question “Can these
bones live?” Every group of natural phenomena, <i>without exception</i>,
has some meaning for those who will interpret nature rather
than bully and slight her, and whatever anointed king may claim
sovereignty over it the humble fact cannot be denied that “whatever
phenomenon is, <i>is</i>.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> Again I would refer to Howes’ inspiring
note: “We live by ideas; we advance by a knowledge of the
facts; content to discover the meaning of phenomena, since the
nature of things will be for ever beyond our grasp.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> The facts
adduced are simple, have a chance of recurring and are widely
distributed among multicellular animals—the botanists and plants
can very well take care of themselves. I must once more state that
I am attaching to the considered facts a value of a somewhat
unusual kind—<i>their intrinsic unimportance</i>. For anyone who has
had to encounter the skilful dialectics and counter-attacks of a
well-equipped neo-Darwinian it is well that he should remember
the maxim of Napoleon, “Be vulnerable nowhere.” It is necessary
to show evidence for Lamarckian factors in which no degree of
selective value, survival-value, can be seen by hostile sharp-shooter
while he works in his trench. The main line of defence, or more
correctly what Hindenburg would call “offensive-defence,” is
therefore made to rest on the phenomena of hair-direction, which,
I submit, are impregnable to the forces of selection, probably in all
the hairy mammals, but certainly in that hairy animal called Man.</p>


<h3>Thesis.</h3>

<p>If these groups of phenomena were being studied apart from
the hypothesis they support, a much more full treatment of all of
them would be required, such as I have given to those of hair-direction
in a book published in 1903 on <i>Direction of Hair in Animals
and Man</i>. The limited thesis, however, here upheld is that the
phenomena are produced by the factors of stimuli and response in<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
the course of the total experience of the organism, that the essence
of the matter is the produc­tion of initial modifications, that instances
of these in well-known animals are produced before our eyes by
ascertainable mechanical stimuli, and that, especially in those of
hair-direction, experiment is adduced in proof of the thesis that
some modifications are transmitted.</p>


<h3>Procedure.</h3>

<p>The order of proceedings may be tabulated <span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p>

<p class="pl5hi">(1) Observation of selected facts.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(2) Evidence that certain of these are produced in the
lifetime of the individual.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(3) Evidence that among the facts of direction of hair and
others there is to be seen an orderly evolution rather than a
casual appearance of the changes noted.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(4) An hypothesis as to their production.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(5) Exclusion of selection as a possible cause of these, and
of correla­tion as properly understood.</p>

<p class="pl5hi">(6) Experiment in verification of the Lamarckian interpreta­tion
of the phenomena.</p>

<p>And here, before I hear some Prince Henry of the genus
Weismann, Mendel or Gallio groan aloud: “This intolerable amount
of sack,” I proceed to offer him a few loaves of home-made bread.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

EVIDENCE FROM ARRANGEMENT OF HAIR.</h2>


<h3><i>Ex Uno Disce Omnes.</i></h3>

<p>The singular arrangement of hair on the forearm of man is the
subject of some curious statements by Darwin, Wallace and
Romanes, and these suggested to me twenty years ago the following
line of thought. To many minds the text will appear a humble
one, but it opens many avenues of inquiry.</p>

<p>These three illustrious men are all more or less inaccurate
and incomplete in their descriptions of the hair on man’s forearm,
though <span class="nowrap">Romanes<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> gives a drawing which supplements his written
account. They looked upon it as a vestige of the pattern of hair
on the forearm of existing anthropoid apes, especially the orang,
in whom its fully-developed form was an adapta­tion governed by
Natural Selection. Of the three, Wallace is the most uncompromising
on behalf of this view, Romanes rather accepts it <i>en passant</i>,
and Darwin in a long <span class="nowrap">passage<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> adopts it with some reserve and his
usual respect for the work of his great co-worker, as the most probable
explana­tion of a fact which lay heavy on his scientific conscience.
Indeed, for all these great men it was a <i>crux</i>, though
Romanes, with his Lamarckian views, need not have found much
difficulty with an alternative account of it<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span></p>

<p>At the time when these statements were made, the lineal
ancestors of man were much more definite personages than they
are now, as Arthur, the legendary Celtic hero, was formerly held
to be an historical personage more than is the case now. These
ancestors were generally believed then to be found among the
four existing anthropoid apes. The picture of our ancestor among<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
the apes, as given by Wallace, in connec­tion with this state of the
hair on his forearm, represents him as spending much of his time
like the gorilla, who, according to Livingstone, “sits in pelting
rain with his hands over his head.” He would no doubt find the
thatch-like arrangement of the hair a tolerably efficient umbrella,
but one may doubt very much if so clever a denizen of the tropics
would fail to find under the great branches of trees, in a tropical
forest, a better covering and one more like the roofs of our houses.
But when we cannot find a roof to our heads we—and the orang
or gorilla—naturally employ a substitute, and not otherwise.
Be that as it may, it is doubtful if the thatch of his forearms would
supply him with that survival value on which the theory of Selection
depends, to say nothing of the fact that in its incipient stage the
reversal of the slope of hair, inherited from the lemur stock, would
be trivial and useless.</p>

<p>But one must ask: “Did man’s Simian ancestor really loaf
away so much of his time in this dull manner? and was the running-off
of rain so frequent and imperative a need as to make him set
to work to invent this special adapta­tion?”</p>

<p>After some millions of years have passed since his day we are
not in a position to go beyond speculations, and this one seems
barely credible, moreover, it is quite unnecessary, as certain following
facts will show.</p>


<h3>Steps of the Inquiry.</h3>

<p>Having expounded the text and its context, I would mention
that in 1897 I came across these views of biologists as to the very
strange arrangement of hair on man’s forearm, and was struck with
the inadequacy of the theory of Darwin, Wallace and Romanes
to account for the state of things which every man can find, if he
looks for it, on his own forearm. I examined a large number of
apes and monkeys so as to test the theory, and the results were
published in <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 55, under the title “Certain vestigial
characters in Man.” Suffice it to say that from the evidence I
brought forward one had to choose between two heresies: either
to deny the Simian ancestry of man or to affirm the inheritance of
some acquired characters; and I chose the latter. The choice
of “evils” or heresies which had to be made then will serve as an
introduc­tion to all that follows.</p>

<p>This article was followed by a paper at the Zoological Society
of London on “The Hair-Slope in certain Typical Mammals,” and
after this came a paper at the same Society, giving evidence and
reason why certain patterns of hair in some mammals should rank<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
as specific characters. Various other papers at the Anatomical
Society of Great Britain and Ireland were read and published and
others at the Zoological Society, in which different regions of the
hairy coat of man and lower mammals were dealt with. In 1903
the whole subject of the Direction of Hair in Animals and Man was
treated in a book freely illustrated.</p>

<p>I then followed the advice of Horace and left the subject alone
for nine years, during which time my further observations and
reflections served but to confirm, except in two or three unimportant
details, the results and conclusions in the book and papers of an
earlier date. The connec­tion between the habits of an animal
and the distribu­tion of its hairy coat were always cropping up,
and I saw then and see now no possible explana­tion of the connec­tion
than that the former is the efficient cause of the latter.</p>


<h3>How the Hair is Arranged on the Forearm.</h3>

<p>Returning now to the text, the remarkable arrangement of
hair on man’s forearm, attention may be directed to the accompanying
figure of the forearm of a lemur, an ape and man, in which the
extensor or back view of this limb-segment is shown, the heavy
“war-arrows” being employed to direct the attention of the reader
to the main lines in which the hair-streams flow. The front or
flexor surfaces in the lemur and ape are not shown because they
are precisely like the corresponding back surfaces, and the flexor
surface in man is shown in the figure. The figures are so much
like diagrams that a very little detailed descrip­tion will suffice.
For the examina­tion of the hair on man’s forearm the best subject
is a dark-haired youth, and it is easily traced, though in any
hairy subject it can be shown up well by placing the forearm
in water for a minute and allowing the water to drain off.
The normal and congenital hair-slope on the forearm is then well
displayed.</p>

<p>On the front surface of man’s forearm the hairs point away
from the elbow and divide in the middle of the surface into two
streams, one passing to the outer and the other to the inner border
in a downward gentle curve, and they join the streams of hair on
the back surface. In this pattern there is nothing very peculiar,
for it is shared by many monkeys.</p>

<p>When the back surface is examined it is found to present an
arrangement of the hair which is <i>unique</i> among hairy mammals.
The figure shows the eccentric course taken by the hair on the
back surface. In the centre, exactly along the extensor border of
the ulna, from the wrist to the point of the elbow, the hair-stream<span class="pagenum hide" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
has been bold enough to turn straight <i>upwards</i> in a narrow line,
and it was here that our three great leaders saw their chance of
claiming for Selection a tiny bit of territory, a kind of Duchy of
Luxembourg between two great States, though, as I proceed to
show, the claim is disallowed and untenable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" height="412" width="600" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig 1.—<span class="smcap">Arrangement of Hair on the Forearm.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the ape the hairs of the forearm are much longer and thicker
than those of man, and both on the front and back all point <i>from
the wrist to the elbow</i>.</p>

<p>In the lemur all the hairs point <i>from the elbow to the
wrist</i>.</p>

<p>In the products of Nature there are no freaks, or impish tricks
performed, and it is not for nothing she does her work. Every
one of them asks for and should receive an explana­tion consistent
with fact and reason, and here comes in the need for studying,
as one may, the broad outlines of man’s ancestry. His ancestor
being now sought in an earlier and more generalized stock than
that of the four genera of anthropoid apes known to us, the most
instructive and safest line to take is to trace him back to the stock
lemur, who remains to-day among the most Chinese or unchanging
of known mammals. In his illuminating work, <i>Prehistoric Man
and History</i>, Professor Scott Elliott adopts an excellent term,
“lemur-monkey-man,” to sum up, without missing links, the long
ancestry of man. I take the liberty of adapting this term more
closely to the present inquiry and use that of <i>lemur-ape-man</i> instead,
for whatever may be the relation of man to present apes some ape-like
ancestors enter into his genealogical tree<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> For my purpose
the monkey is less useful because his hair-slope differs so little
from that of lemurs, whereas apes have made for themselves a
very remarkable position as regards the hair of their forearms.
Our series of animals for study is then well represented by the
lemur-ape-man—hypothetical, necessary and serviceable. Through
all the immense stretch of time occupied in this process of descent
there has been ample opportunity for the lemur to change his
fashion to that of the ape, and the latter to change to the present
fashion of man.</p>

<p>This simple arrangement of the lemur’s hair is common to that
of all the more primitive long-bodied mammals, of which an otter is
a good example, and I venture, greatly daring, to call this the
normal slope of hair. Somewhere and somehow in the human
tree there has appeared a total reversal of the lemur-type; the
stock of apes acquired a new fashion, and gradually discarded<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
altogether their ancient inheritance, beginning their innova­tion
perhaps, with <i>Dryopithecus fontani</i> in the Miocene Age.</p>


<h3>The Dynamics of Hair-Pattern.</h3>

<p>There are a few well-known facts which it is necessary to bear
in mind if one is endeavouring to understand the mode of origin
and order of the events before us. The hairy coat of a mammal is
composed of individual hairs of varying length, colour and thickness,
each being rooted in a tiny pit in the skin and growing from a
papilla at its base. As the hair grows, its free end is pushed away
from the papilla at the rate of one inch in two months. This is
the rate in man’s hair, and it is probably greater in the case of
lower mammals on account of the greater importance and physiological
activity of their hairy coat than in man’s. But one inch
in two months is a close enough calcula­tion. Here, then, is a structure
which grows throughout the whole life of the animal, and has
to dispose itself somehow on the surface of the skin. It does this
<i>in the line of least resistance</i>, and to trace this line is the Alpha and
Omega of the present inquiry.</p>

<p>There is a concep­tion of much value in understanding the
dynamics of the distribu­tion of hair, and that is to view the hair
of mammals as composed of certain streams. As in every illustra­tion,
this concep­tion may be challenged because of some difference
the critic may find between these streams and a stream of fluid.
It certainly does not leave its bed as do the component parts of
a river, a glacier or molten lava, for the base of the hair is fixed.
But it will serve, and is at least not more open to objection than
certain useful metaphors in biology as when the genealogy of man
and animals is pictured as a tree, or the living things of the earth
as a “web of life.” It is, then, as <i>streams moving at the rate of one
inch in two months in the lines of least resistance</i> that I propose to
discuss the animal hair and its diverse patterns and offer no further
apology for doing so. Just as in the cases of a stream of water
with varying banks and rocks in its course, or a glacier with its
mountain-sides and sinuous valleys, or a stream of lava with small
projecting surfaces of a mountain, our stream of hair flows on,
hindered only by adequate obstructions.</p>

<p>Yet another concep­tion from the region of metaphor must be
mentioned. It is one which will commend itself to every mind
which has been steeped in thoughts of warfare for five years. We
are all soldiers now; we think in terms of military affairs. In the
case of our hair-streams there are in many regions two forces
directly opposed to one another, others in which no struggle has<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
yet occurred, as, in the Great War, Italy was not at one period at
open war with Germany.</p>

<p>Between the opposing forces in our small battle-field of the
hairy coat there have been waged battles to which those of Mukden,
Verdun, the Somme and Arras, are not to be compared in point of
time. They are but as one day to a thousand years. On one side of
the conflict in our present chosen field the ancient primitive type of
the lemur has remained entrenched for some millions of years,
until there arose new forces in its descendants on the other side
and this changed the war of positions into one of movement. It
was indeed “a contemptible little army” which came forward to
oppose the ancient barbarian forces of the lemur, long prepared
and organised, and these new armies fought under the banner,
Habit. In the slowly-formed patterns in many types of mammals
we have records of the treaties made after these long struggles and
the rectifications of frontier which became necessary. The critic
may call these “battles of kites and crows,” and ask What war
correspondents were allowed to describe them; but a battle,
whether great or small, long or short, is important to the parties
concerned, and it is open to us to “reconstruct” the facts of the
battle as do the historians on their part, for example, Sir James
Ramsay the battle of Agincourt—with tolerable verisimilitude.
But in science, especially geological science, the process of reconstruc­tion
is much more ambitious and bold than any that is here
attempted. Who has not been fascinated, if he has read Sir E.
Ray Lankester’s work on Extinct Animals, by the skill and daring
with which he conveys to us a vivid idea of the form and mode of
life, with scanty data, of the extinct Moa of New Zealand, the great
Pterodactyle, Pteranodon, or the Diprotodon of Owen—“the
probable appearance in life” of these uncanny but very real
inhabitants of the earth in days long past. How skilfully did Owen
from a piece of bone seven inches long, sent to him by a gentleman
in New Zealand sixty years ago, pronounce it to be a part of the
thigh-bone of a bird like an ostrich, and then after a few years had
passed, confirmed it by more bones of the skeleton, till the large
Moa, extinguished 600 or 700 years ago by the Maoris, lived again
before us—an historical personage; or how by the examina­tion of
the skull and most of its skeleton the giant marsupial from Australia,
Diprotodon, was resuscitated and admired; or again, how from the
bones of the arms, shoulder-girdle and fingers was built up the
strange body of Pteranodon, the great flying dragon. All of which
is the legitimate and approved business of biologists and palæontologists,
and this digression is made here to show that my line of<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
treatment of a little subject agrees with that in a greater one; nay,
it even proceeds in its explanations of events on the ever valuable
principle of Lyell in a still greater one without which to-day geology
would be a thing of naught, that is, the principle of <i>explaining
changes in the surface of the earth by reference to causes now in action</i>.
The objection that one subject is very great and the other very
small is not valid; for one as much as the other there are millions
of years to be had for the asking. Who in these days hesitates to
talk and try to think in millions?—tens of millions of men, millions
of soldiers, millions upon millions of money, millions of bacteria
in vaccines and millions of money belonging to other people disposed
of by the new spendthrift Minister?</p>


<h3>From Lemur to Ape.</h3>

<p>Returning now to our Eocene lemur we must remind ourselves
of the problem before his simple mind and those of his Simian
descendants. How was he to change so greatly the direction of the
hair on his forearm (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>) till it should turn right about face and
imitate those great German “victories” of Hindenburg, well
called Marshal Rückwarts? The problem lies open in the Figure
and receiving no aid from Selection or survival of the fittest, in
this little effort, he had to fall back on the eternal and tedious
force of habit and use. I am afraid if here I were interrupted by
some critic, more learned than wise, by a summary demand on the
part of Selection for its share in the result, I should be tempted to
reply with the word Φλυαρια employed by George Borrow, forbearing
to give the transla­tion of the reply as he gives it. Anyhow,
it is a case in which to “listen politely and change the subject.”</p>

<p>Here comes in the aspect of strife between primitive and new
obstructing forces in a little hair-stream. The lemur lives in trees
and carries on a stealthy nocturnal business, moving on all fours
in quest of his daily bread, and no external force or new habit avails
to modify the hair-slope on his forearms, and so it remains until
some primitive form of monkey, gradually evolving into a primitive
ape, brings into the family new habits and customs. Other men
and other manners appear in the Miocene Age. Our supposed
Dryopithecus fontani becomes more upright in his bodily, and
perhaps his moral habits, and spends an increasing amount of his
leisure time in the sitting posture; his hands are frequently grasping
a bough as he sits and reflects, it may be in a man-ward direction,
or, as is more likely, on his last meal of nuts and fruits. But he did
not spend quite so much time as Wallace and others think in this
futile attitude, for he knew in his way as much as the modern<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
bachelor does, of making his posture comfortable and restful when
he was not out at work, and he varied his plans by resting his
forearms on his thigh, crouched up and cosy, and doubtless slept
much in this attitude. All these bold departures from his lemur-ancestor’s
habits had the necessary result of altering the slope of
his hair on the forearms, which was now growing as long and coarse
as we see it to-day in the orang. In course of milleniums the
ancient forces yielded to those of the new armies, and the once
normal slope became reversed in a way which shocked the conservative
lemurs of his day. It requires little imagina­tion to see
how the lengthening thickening hairs on this limb-segment became
changed in their direction by friction against the opposing surfaces
of the thighs, by gravita­tion, and the frequent dripping of rain
when they were held up to grasp a bough. Here then we see at
work new forces of friction, pressure, gravita­tion and dripping of
rain, turning endlessly and slowly the lemur-fashion into the ape-fashion,
with unlimited time for their effectual action. In this
stock of Man’s ancestry Selection was taking care of the individual
and Habit of the details of his making—two truly harmonious
partners.</p>


<h3>From Ape to Man.</h3>

<p>Another step, and a long one, has still to be taken from the
ape-fashion to that of man. Bearing in mind that the lemur-fashion
has been totally reversed by the ape it startles one to find
that man in his modern fashion has largely reverted to that of the
lemur on the front and sides of his forearm. This is clearly shown
in Figure <a href="#Fig_1">1</a>. There also you see graphically recorded in the hair
of the extensor border of the ulna, a little <i>backward</i> streak, a poor
little legacy of fifty pounds from the fortunes of many thousands
once possessed by the ape. From the present limited point of view,
man is a veritable pauper, and his possessions in this limb-segment
may with some irony well be called a “vestige.”</p>

<p>Professor Scott-Elliott in his book, <i>Prehistoric Man and His
Story</i>, p.&nbsp;60, goes rather wide of the mark here in his graphic picture
of our rude ancestor and his hard life. He gives too strongly the
idea of him sitting asleep in raging gales, in driving rain which is
neatly conducted by the thatch of his hair off his skin. As far
as it goes this need not be questioned, as a matter of probability,
but he states far too broadly “The hair on the arm, even of those
civilised men who retain sufficient to trace the arrangement, turns
down both upper and forearm to the elbow<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span>—true as to the<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
upper arm, but only true of the forearm in a very narrow streak
of hair over the extensor surface of the ulna. The fact is that in
every human being, not too old, its course can be traced with a
lens. He overlooks also from this protective point of view the
fact that the ape or early man, in the position of rest he describes,
would have very much the reverse of protec­tion from the “lie”
of the hair on his thighs, for this is towards the knee and is well
calculated to catch the rain and conduct it carefully, or let it run,
into his groins. So the protec­tion theory (under the empire of
Selection) is again in straits. But I must not forget my self-denying
ordinance alluded to in the Preface, but will show how
the ape fashion began to be modified into its present and probably
final form in man. Still further changes in the simple habits of the
earliest men became frequent, and fresh forces were organised
in our mimic battlefield. Gravita­tion gradually ceased to act
as the hairs became thinner and shorter. Friction and pressure
changed their lines of incidence with the increasing tendency of
man to assume the upright posture, for the surfaces exposed to
pressure and friction were only affected when the extensor surface
or back of the forearm rested on some supporting object, an attitude
extremely common in man as we know him now. Then came the
opportunity of the primitive barbarian host, the lemur fashion,
by a prolonged counter-attack to recover on the greater part of the
forearm the ground lost millions of years before by the ape, and
then was engraved on the forearm of man the permanent treaty
which we have before us to-day.</p>

<p>This small and apparently trivial battle-ground has been
described at what may seem undue length, but it is a miniature of
the rise and fall of little empires such as here engage our attention,
and I make no apology for this to the reader who has gone thus
far with me, for, on the principle of <i>ex uno disce omnes</i>, all that
follows in other areas of the hairy coat of mammals will be the
clearer, and little repeti­tion will be needed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Two terms have been used somewhat freely in this Introduc­tion,
“vestige” and “normal,” and a few remarks upon them are not out of place,
for they are both somewhat ambiguous and apt to be carelessly employed.</p>

<p>A vestige in biological writings is almost the exclusive property of the
Pan-Selectionists, and no one can doubt that on the one hand it is a far more
correct term than that of rudiment which Darwin employed so freely, on the
other that they have a perfectly legitimate claim to it in a large number of
obsolete structures of animal forms. But vestiges, footsteps, footprints,
have another and equally correct meaning, even if less often thus employed,
in the fact that a vestige or footprint may just as well be a relic of what the
race and individuals have <i>done</i>, as a relic of what they have <i>retained</i> in the
way of possession, and I submit that the facts and arguments I have here
advanced afford a valid claim to the term “vestige” in the results of certain
<i>doings</i> on the part of animals—as will appear later still more clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span></p>

<p>The term “normal” is a fine field for dialectics, but neither ordinary
men nor scientific students can do their work without its use, and yet it
would have been an intellectual treat to have heard how Huxley, for example,
would have turned inside out any opponent who chose to employ it to his
dissatisfac­tion. In a strictly-conducted tournament no evolutionary biologist
would allow its use—to his adversary. A norm for him exists only
as one of Professor Karl Pearson’s “conceptual counters,” a piece of mental
shorthand or hardly more than a <i>pis aller</i>. Among the fundamental conceptions
of organic evolution there is one which is almost a truism, the doctrine
of Heraclitus, πἁντα ρε̑ι, the everlasting flux and change of Nature and her
products. In strict logic, according to what we all now believe, there
is no possible norm. All that one may do is to take stock at a certain epoch
of evolution and label, for our own convenience, some group, or organism
or structure as “normal”—and go on with our business, collecting some
specimens, calling them type-specimens, and putting them in books or cases
in the Natural History Museum—and then proceed to business.</p>

<p>The biological teacher in his class room says he must live, he must have
his tools for his work, to which the idle student replies under his breath,
“I do not see the necessity,” but then few students are now idle, and this
jibe does not sting any one! The examiner must have his normal human
anatomy, and would ruthlessly plough any daring examinee who tried to
sophisticate the meaning of the term “normal.” I have often been struck
with what I must call the intellectual audacity of a most eminent leader in
physical science and mathematics, who is not unlike a certain great Church,
which grants nothing to her adversaries but is not averse from taking. In
his <i>Grammar of Science</i>, written with a pen dipped in hydrochloric acid,
Professor Karl Pearson four times over, and perhaps more, has the courage
to call the human brain in this twentieth century “normal.” Has he never
heard of the coming Superman of Mr. Bernard Shaw and other prophets?
Thinking <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> has he here in the West, and at a certain small
epoch of time, any right to call the human brain “normal”? I can only
long that there may be more normal brains such as Professor Karl Pearson’s,
and am almost inclined to echo the prayer of Moses, “Would God all
the Lord’s people were [such] prophets”! These comments on the term
“normal” imply no complaint against its use, indeed are a claim for it, and
I deprecate very much that form of criticism known in boys’ schools, domestic
circles, and among politicians as the <i>tu quoque</i> reply, and I hope the few
ambiguous terms used in this book will pass the censor, and help the reader.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

THE EVOLUTION OF PATTERNS OF HAIR.</h2>


<p>Some attention must here be given to the supposed mode of formation
of individual patterns of hair, that is to say, their evolution.
So here one has to move among the fields of hypothesis, without
which detached facts of nature are useless to science.</p>

<p>The simplest pattern consists of a reversed area of hair
appearing between two adjoining streams; the more complex
are whorls, featherings and crests. No detailed descrip­tion nor
illustra­tion of the former are required, but I have prepared a
diagram to illustrate the latter (see p.&nbsp;51.) (<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>) shows a whorl by
itself; (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) a whorl, feathering and crest. The arrows at the sides
indicate the direction of the adjoining hair-streams, the arrow in
the centre of (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) the direction of the reversed flow of hair.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;">
<a id="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" height="546" width="230" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 2.—<span class="lowercase smcap">A.</span> Diagram of a whorl.<br />
<span class="lowercase smcap">B.</span> Diagram of a whorl (<span class="lowercase smcap">W</span>)
a fea­ther­ing (<span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>) a crest (<span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>).</p></div>
</div>

<p>An understanding of the dynamics of a hair-whorl leads quite
simply to that of a feathering and crest, for the two latter are
only the results of the further extension of the battle of forces
concerned in the whorl itself, and the end of their conflict. A
whorl marks a point in the stream of hair where two contending
forces have come into collision; on the one hand the centrifugal
force of growth from each hair-papilla, the rate of which has been
described, and on the other a certain centripetal dynamic force
which may be either that of localised <i>friction</i>, <i>pressure</i>, <i>gravita­tion</i>, or
<i>muscular traction</i>, directly opposing or divergent. Thus conceived
a whorl may be looked at symbolically as a written treaty between
two nations, one of which has defeated the other, and actually as
a proof that the contending centrifugal and centripetal forces are
in the state called the balance of power. But when the centripetal
force of some habitual action prevails over that of the original
force of growth in the hair, a whorl becomes extended into a
feathering, and the length of this, metaphorically speaking,
corresponds with the duration of open fighting, and terminated by
a sharp crest when another and a decisive battle has been fought.
A crest may again be looked upon as a “treaty.” The whole
process pictured here shows a battle followed by a treaty or truce
(<span class="lowercase smcap">W</span>) again a retreat (<span class="lowercase smcap">F</span>) and a counter-attack (<span class="lowercase smcap">C</span>) with a final treaty
and peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p>

<p>This hypothetical treatment, with addition of some metaphors,
does not carry us far enough to leave it thus to the tender mercy
of that class of critic who relies too much on the “argument from
ignorance.” He tells us such a process as I have pictured may
be true or not, and that no one
can do more than leave the case
open, and treat it like that of
Jarndyce &amp; Jarndyce where it
would remain in Chancery till all
of us concerned in the inquiry
have returned to our dust. The
critic might reasonably ask for
experiments which will bear out
the suggested views. But verifica­tion
by calculated experiments
is impossible, for, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, the
variations or patterns which are
described require long periods of
time for their produc­tion. Such
experiments being ruled out, the
evidence in favour of the hypothesis
must be sought in some
region of the hairy coat of
mammals where whorls, featherings
and crests can be observed
in all stages of their formation.</p>


<h3>The Side of the Horse’s Neck.</h3>

<p>The field chosen for observa­tion
is, from one point of view,
the most remarkable among all
the numerous regions in the great
series of hair-clad mammals. The
side of the neck in the domestic
horse displays all degrees and
forms of whorls, featherings and
crests in such variety as to be
almost bewildering. I must have
examined many thousands of specimens of this valuable large
mammal in reference to this state of things on the side of its neck,
and can only regret that I have not kept any record of them as to
number or quality, and I fear the opportunity for doing so will
not return in this country. There are three reasons for this choice<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
of field. In the <i>first</i> place there is or was an extensive supply of
the specimens for examina­tion; in the <i>second</i>, the side of a horse’s
neck is a region where no extraneous or artificial agents, such as
harness, except a bridle, can operate, and therefore Nature and
the animal’s habits have free play; in the <i>third</i> the neck of a horse
in its locomotive life is subject to powerful mechanical forces which
are <i>constant</i>, literally speaking, while it walks, trots, canters or
gallops. Here then, if anywhere, one may read the records, in
indelible characters of hair patterns, the history of its active life
and that of its ancestors, and here also one may reasonably expect
to find these patterns in every possible stage of formation, from a
mere rudiment to the most finished product in a whorl, feathering
and crest—<i>and this is precisely what is found to exist</i>.</p>

<p>Even an observer not acquainted with the anatomy of this
region who watches closely a horse in action cannot fail to notice
how at every step taken there is a marked jolt of the neck produced
in the neck by the impact of its hoofs with the ground and in supporting
its heavy skull. I have computed several times the number of
jolts that the neck of a trotting horse sustains, in my numerous
rides behind various horses, during many hundreds of miles, and
have reckoned the number which occur in a horse trotting for an
hour, at the usual rate at which a doctor travels. This is on the
average 6,000, and of course the numbers of jolts in walking, cantering,
and galloping vary according to these different paces. But a
great deal more of movement of the head and neck is observed
beside the jolt at every step. See how the animal tosses up its
head, twists it to this and that side for the mere <i>joie de vivre</i> when
it is fresh, or, even when hindered by blinkers<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> how he turns his
head to look at every passing object in the road with his ancestral
caution, how he will pass contemptuously a great horse-waggon
or even now a villainous-looking motor lorry, but will peer at a
beggar woman sitting beside the road, or a heap of stones, or a
yapping cur! All this vivid muscular work of a horse’s head and
neck hardly ceases while he is in action and at any rate not till he
is dead beat, and the higher the courage and breeding of the horse
the more frequent and brisk are his movements. Is it possible
to conceive a region of the body of any large mammal where more
numerous, varied, and powerful action of underlying muscles can<span class="pagenum hide" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
be found playing their ceaseless tricks on the sober normal slope
of hair in the skin which covers them? If there be any region
approaching this I have not found it.</p>

<p>The main facts of the anatomy of the horse’s neck must be
referred to here, so that a better picture may be obtained as to
the powerful forces which are found in conflict during the locomotive
life of the animal. Fig.&nbsp;3 shows the superficial layer of muscles
concerned in the actions of its head and neck, and the manner in
which adjoining muscles diverge from one another should be noted.
Fig.&nbsp;4 gives the deepest layer of neck-muscles, the shoulder-blade
having been removed, and Fig.&nbsp;5 the immensely strong <i>ligamentum
nuchae</i>, of yellow elastic tissue, which extends from the base of
the skull to the great projecting spinous process of the lowest
cervical and second and third dorsal vertebræ.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 5.—Ligaments and tendons supporting the head and neck of
the horse.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are here indeed great forces for conflict—<i>first</i> a layer
of strong superficial muscles, <i>second</i> a layer of smaller muscles
which has not been figured, <i>third</i> a deep layer of muscles, and
<i>fourth</i> a powerful, widely-spread and strongly-attached mass of<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
dense elastic tissue, adapted for supporting the head without
muscular exertion, but by its elasticity allowing a downward jerk
of the head and neck at every step. It is an exceedingly important
structure for a domestic horse.</p>


<h3>The Normal Arrangement of Hair.</h3>

<p>So much for the active part played by a horse’s neck and
head, and for the simpler anatomical facts of the region involved.
Before proceeding to describe the results of these as seen in the
hair, it is well to make sure of a point which a critic might raise.
“How do you know,” says he, “that some of the variations in
this highly variable region of the hair are not normal. What
is the normal type here?” A very easy answer to this is found
by studying, not only any Ungulate known, except the Gnu, but
more particularly all wild Equidæ; and this reveals the fact that
in all this series the normal slope of hair prevails here, that is to
say, an even trend from head to shoulder. Variations in others,
indeed, hardly exist, and I may add that the absence of variations
here is a strong piece of negative evidence in my favour, for no
Ungulate comes near the domestic horse for amount and activity
of locomo­tion, which is indeed his <i>raison d’être</i>. He is the only one
that has invented new patterns. But a little direct evidence can
be brought which clinches this argument from inference based on
ancestry. I made an examina­tion, at the stables of Messrs. Tilling,
at Peckham, of 100 consecutive specimens of hackney, for the
purpose of ascertaining the propor­tion in that group of those that
showed the normal slope on the neck to those with variations.
In 62 of these the normal existed on both sides of the neck, 18
Normal on one side, and in the remaining 20 there were variations
on both sides. If 100 specimens of horses contain 80 with one side
and 62 with both normal the previous inference requires no further
support.</p>


<h3>Fourteen Varieties.</h3>

<p>I have put together here, and described, fourteen out of a much
larger number of the most instructive varieties of pattern that I
have been able to collect during the course of many years and
examina­tion of several thousand horses. They comprise examples
the mostly likely, as I think, to convey to the reader an adequate
picture of the results of the strength, number and variety of
mechanical forces in our present battle-field of hair. The diagrams
almost speak for themselves, but a short written descrip­tion will
help to emphasise the salient points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span></p>

<p>There are pictured here the normal type, divergent hair-streams
partially reversed, simple whorls in different regions, a
whorl and feathering, whorls, featherings and crests, and these in
several areas. It is a veritable portrait gallery in which is portrayed
the earliest and latest stages of this family of fashions in hair on
the horse’s neck. They are grouped mostly in pairs.</p>

of them came before me during many years of a “Captain-Cuttle-like”
disposal of some of my leisure. No clearer proof can be
desired of the view here advanced, that habit or habitual muscular
action, and jolting, is the cause of the varied patterns in this field,
and that according to the Law of Parcimony no other is required,
this canon of Occam being expressed more succinctly—<i>Neither
more, nor more onerous causes are to be assumed than are necessary
to account for the phenomena</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

CAN MUSCULAR ACTION CHANGE THE DIRECTION
OF HAIR IN THE INDIVIDUAL?</h2>


<p>It might seem unnecessary to most persons who are good enough
to follow this inquiry that the question asked above should receive
an explicit answer. We all know, of course, how a man’s hair is
said to stand on end in excessive states of horror or rage, and how
a short-haired terrier’s back bristles at the sight of certain foes.
But it is not so simple a matter to show that the direction of the
hair is permanently changed. I submit that the persons I mention
are right in their opinion for this work contains evidence throughout
that muscular action beneath the skin is the efficient cause in many
regions of the formation of hair patterns. But like Kirkpatrick
when Bruce struck down the Red Comyn we had best “make sicker,”
and give as much evidence of the affirmative question as any
critic can demand.</p>


<h3>Hairs of Human Eyebrows.</h3>

<p>As in the previous chapter I chose an open and plain field for
the evidence bearing on the formation of whorls and the like,
so here I turn to one still more clear for him who runs to read.
In these days old men are of less account than in earlier and simpler
times, but I claim to have found “a new use for old men” as I
had almost thought of calling this chapter. In this somewhat
neglected group we have an almost unlimited number of specimens
for examina­tion, and in their eyebrows they furnish a valuable
field for tracing some striking results of underlying muscular
traction.</p>

<p>Darwin made one of his few mistakes when he included among
rudimentary and inherited <span class="nowrap">structures<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> those few long hairs which
are often seen in the eyebrows of man, looking upon them as representatives
of those found in some species of macacus and the
chimpanzee. That great and modest man was, I am sure, not in
the habit of making much use of the looking-glass—not more than
women who, as we know, rarely do such a thing. But if he did<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
he would have observed in his own splendid frontal region and
brows excellent examples of the phenomena which form the subject
of this chapter. This I know, though I never saw him in the flesh,
for it so happens that in the great volume published in the jubilee
of The Origin, and called <i>Darwin and Modern Science</i>, two good
photographs of him, at the ages of thirty-five and about seventy-one
are reproduced. These both show, but the later one much more
clearly, good examples of these long and not very ornamental
aberrant hairs. Thirty-five years of arduous thought and work
had told their tale on him and twisted from their normal paths the
lengthening thickening hairs of his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Also, if he had looked a little beyond the eyebrows he would
have seen some very deep wrinkles of the skin on his forehead and
round his orbits. It is these two groups of facts, wrinkles and
twisted, changed hairs of man’s eyebrows, which give the answer
to the question “Can muscular action change the direction of hair
in the individual?”</p>

<p>In 1903 I drew the attention of the Anatomical Society of
Great Britain and Ireland to these two groups of facts under the
title “Notes on the Eyebrows of Man,” and presented some large
drawings of individual elderly men of my acquaintance, and the
present chapter is only an extension of that little piece of work.</p>

<p>No area of the mammalian skin is so useful and easy to follow
as this in answering the present question, for though the previous
chapter supplied part of the answer in a very fruitful field, the proof
still remained one of “tremendous probability” and not more.
But in the frontal and superciliary region of man there is complete
proof of the truth of the affirmative answer, as I shall show.</p>

<p>Here again we must encounter our old friend the normal slope
of hair. As I stated in 1903, “The normal arrangement of the hair
on the eyebrows of a moderately hairy subject is as follows: in
the middle line the hairs of the two sides tend to meet and form a
somewhat confused group of hairs; passing away from the middle
line the hairs assume a nearly sagittal direction, then become
more sloped away, and a sharp change in the direction of the
<i>frontal</i> and <i>orbital</i> streams brings the remaining hairs into that
regular accurate arrangement of a united stream so characteristic
of a hairy subject, and this passes along the superciliary ridge
to the external angular process”—all of which can be seen at a
glance by any one who looks closely enough, as with the eyes of a
lover, for example, at the brows of a dark-haired maid or youth.
In the young these hairs lie close to the skin, and with that very
interesting group of persons we have no more to do here, except<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
for one piece of practical advice to them which they will find at
the end of the present chapter.</p>


<h3>Evidence from Artists.</h3>

<p>More than one kind of evidence may be brought forward in
this case, and I propose to “put in” a certain class of witness
that not the most acute cross-examining counsel, Daniel O’Connell,
Hawkins, or even Sergeant Buzfuz, can shake. I pity that young
man or woman to-day who has not mended several holes in his
education by reading the books of Dickens and Lever in editions
illustrated by the immortal Phiz. If I do no more for him by this
passage than induce him to mend such holes I shall have been of
some use to his mind. For my part I look upon Phiz as far superior
to Hogarth or Cruikshank in the fidelity to nature of his drawings
of the faces of his numerous characters, especially the old men.
Look through <i>Dombey &amp; Son</i>, <i>Bleak House</i>, <i>Pickwick Papers</i>,
<i>Barnaby Rudge</i>, <i>Tom Burke</i>, <i>Jack Hinton</i>, <i>Harry Lorrequer</i>, <i>The
O’Donohue</i>, and, perhaps best of all for the illustrations, <i>The Knight
of Gwynne</i>. Examine, with a lens if necessary, the delicate way
in which Phiz shows the projecting hairs on the eyebrows of his
many elderly men, and note at the same time the truth to scientific
fact which he shows in his <i>female</i> characters, for only in the drawings
of “Mrs. Gamp proposes a toast” and of Mrs. Pipchin in “Paul
and Mrs. Pipchin,” and one or two doubtful instances, can I find
that he represents even his elderly women with this feature of their
eyebrow hairs. But see Captain Cuttle and Mr. Bunsby in “Solemn
references to Mrs. Bunsby,” both with strongly-marked shelves
of hair sticking out from the brows, Captain Cuttle in “The shadow
in the little parlour,” one of the fat coachmen in “Mr. Weller and
his friends drinking to Mr. Pell”—the sharp brush projecting
from the brow of Bagnet in “Mr. Smallweed breaks the pipe of
peace,” that of Vholes in “Attorney and Client, fortitude and
impatience”—(the equally remarkable absence of this feature in
Pecksniff, Chadband and Skimpole, men without character or
feeling)—Gashford in “Lord George Gordon,” the fat figure in
“The Gallant Vintner,” Pioche in “Minette in attendance on
Pioche,” the courtier in “Louis XIV. and de Genchy,” “The
death of Shaun,” the blind man in “Joe the mighty hunter,”
the right hand figure in “Mr. O’Leary creating a sensation,”
Sir Archibald Mc’Nab in “A fireside group,” “Roade’s return
to O’Donoughue Castle,” Sandy Mc’Grane and Old Hickman in
“Sandy expedites the doctor,” Daly in “Daly bestows a helmet
on Bully Dodd,” the knight in <span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>“The Knight is taken Prisoner.”</p>

<p>Another witness to the scientific facts of the frequent presence
of these hairs on the eyebrows of elderly men, and the rarity of
them in those of women, is the dear friend of our youth, our friend
even to hoar hairs, the <i>Book of Nonsense</i>, by Edward Lear. Here
in 110 vivid drawings of several hundred characters, each of them
sketched with a few bold strokes, is inscribed again and again this
peculiar feature. Look at the “Old man with a nose,” the “Old
Man of th’Abruzzi,” the “Old man of Melrose,” the “Old man of
Calcutta,” the “Old Person of Anerley,” the “Old Person of
Chester,” all with strange and striking bushes of long hairs standing
out from their brows. Again see how hardly one of the female
characters shows a trace of it even in that most truculent “Grandmother
of the Young Person of Smyrna” who threatened to burn
her, though her vertical wrinkles are formidable, or in the remarkable
face of the wife of the “Old Man of Peru.” The “Old Lady of
Prague” shows it in a moderate degree. Support of this kind
may be trivial, and so will the opposing counsel say is that of a
burglar’s finger-prints, but, <i>quâ</i> evidence, it is as strong as that
which commits the criminal to a prison on this modern proof.
No one can suppose that Phiz and Lear fifty or sixty years ago
had a prophetic and treacherous insight into the harmless labours
of a man in the year 1920 who would exploit their labours to the
advantage of his hypothesis, and that they faked their caricatures
for such a purpose. This is the only alternative line for Sergeant
Buzfuz to take unless he acknowledge the facts to be facts, and
betake himself to abuse of the plaintiff’s attorney.</p>


<h3>Eyebrows Interpreted by Wrinkles.</h3>

<p>When one comes to the interpreta­tion of the curious shapes
taken by these hairs one is not left to inference, for Nature has
put some indelible stamps on the forehead and round the orbits of
the men examined. These are wrinkles which have been long in
prepara­tion and only begin to show themselves fully when the
“evil days” have come, in the ’fifties, ’sixties and ’seventies.</p>

<p>I will describe the wrinkles first, and then their results, with
examples, in the numerous fashions of the hairs. Wrinkles are of
two kinds, pathological and physiological, in other words the
former are the results of degenera­tion and wasting of the subcutaneous
fat and loss of its normal elasticity, and are found in the faces
of nearly all men and women, with advancing age, and they are
the subject of much distress in the fair sex and a good deal of
“beauty doctoring.” The latter are the result of long-continued
and repeated action of certain small muscles. The former are<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
numerous, shallow and fine, the latter few and comparatively deep.
The difference between elderly women and men in respect of the
projecting hairs is not that men have many more physiological
wrinkles, but that the hairs of women in this region do not stiffen
and grow long nearly so much as those of men.</p>

<p>There are three groups of wrinkles found on the human forehead
and face, <i>vertical</i>, <i>arched</i> or horizontal and <i>orbital</i>. This division of
wrinkles is a natural one, for each group is produced by the action of
different muscles, the <i>vertical</i> by the corrugator muscle, which is a
narrow band passing from under the frontalis muscle inwards, where
it is attached to the bone between the two eyebrows; the <i>arched</i> by
the action of the frontalis muscle, one which moves the scalp and in
doing so elevates the eyebrows; the <i>orbital</i> by the elliptic orbicularis
muscle which closes the eyelids. These muscles are shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_20">20</a>.</p>

<p><i>Vertical</i> wrinkles are found in the central region of the forehead
and sometimes occupy the middle line with a deep furrow, more
often they are bilateral and symmetrical, near the inner fourth
part of the eyebrow, and sometimes they are placed at different
distances from the middle line.</p>

<p><i>Arched</i> wrinkles extend over the forehead in a series of lines
which are usually concentric with the curve of the eyebrows, but
are sometimes nearly horizontal.</p>

<p><i>Orbital</i> wrinkles may lie in a radiating plan all round the
outer lower and inner borders of the orbit, and in some persons
they are found lying over the curves of the orbicularis muscle itself.</p>


<h3>Some Examples.</h3>

<p>The variations in the long hairs of men’s eyebrows present
some very singular tufts, and I have added below nine figures
of certain cases examined and noted by myself, and these are,
I hope, plain enough without any more detailed account than is
given in the few words describing each.</p>

<p>Unless one’s attention be specially directed to these aberrant
hairs, which are extremely common, one would not expect that
hairs could be so variously twisted by muscular action beneath
them. You may see a tuft of long hair projecting from the plane
of the eyebrows towards the inner end, looking like a small horn,
and I have measured individual hairs in elderly persons and found
many an inch in length and a few an inch and a half. Such a tuft
gives a fierce look to the countenance if the hairs are bushy and
plentiful. The celebrated Dr. Keate, the flogging Head of Eton,
a fiery strenuous person, was noted for the extraordinary long<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
horn of thick hair in his eyebrows, which he appeared to use as a
supplementary finger to point to this or that object of his terrifying
attention. You may also see a man with a great drooping curtain
of hairs overhanging his eyes, half hiding the upper lids and eyes.
Another will show at the outer end of the eyebrows a bristling bush
of hairs turning upwards in the aggressive manner of Wilhelm II.
of evil memory, or of Mr. Roosevelt in former times. Again the
outer points of the eyebrow hairs may turn downwards like a
cavalry moustache, or the hairs may stand out at right angles as a
level shelf. The fashions of these “orbital moustaches” appear
to be as numerous as those of the upper lip.</p>


<h3>A Conflict of Forces.</h3>

<p>If the eyebrows are studied in the light of the three muscles
displayed in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_20">20</a> it is seen to contain an interesting congeries
of small forces in conflict. (1) The <i>frontalis</i> moves the eyebrow
directly upwards. I had a friend once about seventy years old
who was a very vigorous, strong-willed man and he spoke with
decision and energy. It was most interesting to watch how his
frontalis muscle strongly and frequently contracted as he spoke
and drew up his eyebrows so that one might, as it were, measure
the strength of his expressed convictions by the rate of action of
his <i>frontalis</i> muscle! (2) The <i>corrugator</i> draws the skin of the eyebrow
inwards to the middle line thus acting at a right angle to the
line of the <i>frontalis</i>. (3) The <i>orbicularis</i> in the upper part directly
opposes the action of the <i>frontalis</i> and in the lower acts “on its
own” in closing the lower lid. This little spot is a Hill 60, destroyed
at the battle of Messines, and has been the scene of much fighting
throughout life, and it bears abiding witness in the twists and
curves of the long hairs to the severity of the struggles. These
actions of the three contending muscles are involuntary and of a
reflex character, and much employed in such habits as those of
knitting the brows or in elevating or depressing them, all this being
set going and controlled by cerebral action. Incidentally then the
preponderance of one or more of these actions over others, as shown
in the hair, is evidence, as far as it goes, of the disposi­tion and
character of the possessor. So that between the wrinkles and
the twisted hairs of his brow the elderly man, and less so the woman,
carries about an engraved statement, for his friends or enemies
to read, of his natural disposi­tion and his acquired habits, in a
limited field—his written character!</p>

<h3>A Side-Issue.</h3>

<p>This conclusion brings me to the piece of gratuitous advice
I offer to the unmarried reader. It will be more likely to appeal
to the woman than the man, I believe. Let such an one who is
contemplating matrimony make a short study of wrinkles and the
long hairs if possible—unfortunately she cannot do this of her
prospective mate if he be at all young, for neither of these features
will be pronounced as yet. I recommend instead a study of the
wrinkles and hairs of the father and mother and a deliberate summing-up
of the evidence in this way. If she wishes to have a
cheery, genial, hopeful companion in life like B.&nbsp;W. (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_26">26</a>) let her
seek as many arched wrinkles in his parents as possible and avoid
very deep vertical wrinkles. If she be herself of that disposi­tion
she will want a mate of different qualities and may venture on one
whose balance of family wrinkles inclines to the vertical, <i>see</i> Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_28">28</a>,
R.&nbsp;N. She can risk that, and perhaps get a more capable and
strenuous comrade in life’s battle. But let her beware of him
whose wrinkles are all of the vertical kind; for he will be thoughtful,
moody, abstracted and not too good-tempered. I would rather
myself join my fortunes to one who could claim a large share of
arched wrinkles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

HABITS AND HAIR OF UNGULATES.</h2>


<h3>Horses.</h3>

<p>The Ungulate order has been variously divided by zoologists,
and is still said to be composed of two main sections, even-toed
and odd-toed Ungulates, with the addition of a good many “outsiders”
if one may use the term.</p>

<p>These sections form two sub-orders, and the division suits
my purpose here very well. I take the odd-toed sub-order of the
Ungulata Vera first.</p>


<h3>Lessons from the Domestic Horse.</h3>

<p>The domestic horse is the only member of this section that
requires detailed attention, and its value for studying the direction
of the mammalian hair is great, on account of the immense number
of specimens available, the quality and varied distribu­tion of its
hair, the size of the animal, and, most of all, our intimate knowledge
of its habits of life for many thousands of years.</p>

<p>Many volumes have been written by man about this, his best
and second oldest friend among lower animals. His ancestry,
his story as servant of man, his virtues, strength, speed, intelligence,
his use for war and peace, his colour, varieties of breed and money
value; his anatomy, physiology, pathology, his medicine and surgery
have all been written by many able men. Indeed before the great
revela­tion of what man can be and do that the great war has given
us, many observers of mankind were prepared to adapt the saying
of a French cynic and to declare: “The more I see of men the
better I like horses.” Swift at any rate came near this in his bitter
account of a voyage to the Houyhnhnms, which lasted sixteen
years and seven months, towards the end of which he said: “For
who can read of the virtues I have mentioned in the glorious
Houyhnhnms without being ashamed of his own vices, when he
considers himself as the reasoning governing animal of his country?”
But in all these writings, even in that last striking book by Mr.
Roger Pocock, <i>Horses</i>, little or no attention is given to the patterns
of its coat from the point of view of science. I remember reading<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
a paper on this subject many years ago before a distinguished
company of veterinary surgeons, and though they had glanced at
these patterns in a passing way, as peculiarities, no real knowledge
of them nor attempt to understand them was shown by this body
of experts. They were too “practical” for this view of things.
I may remark here that many of the most vocal and active among
us, and especially the Germans, have been overmuch disposed to
study science <i>ad hoc</i>, for its commercial and military value, though
here, as elsewhere one must be tolerant and each follow his own
taste, seeking light, more light. One must live and let live.</p>

<p>The horse does his work <i>coram publico</i> in every street of
every town, in fields, roads and race-courses, and displays on his
hairy coat some graceful patterns which are at the same time
subjects for scientific inquiry, and brands of his long servitude to
man. I have examined many thousands of horses in some twenty
years with never failing interest. Belonging to the large family
of Equidæ, including <i>asses</i>, <i>zebras</i> and <i>quaggas</i>, he is the most
highly-developed of them all. His habits first, and then the most
notable of his hair-patterns must now be considered.</p>


<h3>Some Habits of the Horse.</h3>

<p>He has few habits which bear on the present subject, and of
these his active habits of locomo­tion are far the most important.
He has his share of passive habits, for he stands many hours a
day, and often sleeps standing, and he does his share in lying down,
though Mr. Roger Pocock says he takes no more than four hours’
sleep in this attitude. His rule in lying down is to “lie anyhow,”
if one may so describe it, and thus his two passive attitudes of
standing and lying, have little or no bearing on the questions before
us. His glory is in his gallop, canter, trot and walk. His business
is indeed a <i>going concern</i> in more than one sense, perhaps in three.
The world is moving fast in its old age, and some men are calculating
how long it may take for him to become as nearly extinct as the
<i>quagga</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 30.—Front view of horse show­ing
pec­toral pattern A, B, C.</p></div>
</div>

<p>With the clue given to this inquiry in Chapter VI. we need
have little difficulty in tracing the manner in which his locomotive
life, ancestral and personal, is engraved on his hairy coat.
We shall bear in mind the <i>primitive direction of his hair</i>, <i>hair-streams</i>,
<i>lines of least resistance</i>, and the powerful forces of <i>underlying
traction</i> of muscles, opposed or divergent.</p>

<p>It is, of course, most convenient to examine a specimen with
a fine, short coat rather than one with its wild and more shaggy
hair remaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span></p>

<p>The two regions where the play of great forces comes most
powerfully into action during locomo­tion are round about the elbow-joint
(which we should be disposed to call the shoulder) and the
hip-joint, in which regions the range of extension and flexion, as
well as the number of muscles engaged, is much greater than at
any other part of the limbs. It is in the neighbourhood of these
two regions that the most
characteristic of all the
patterns of hair are
found, and the names
given to the patterns
(whorls, featherings and
crests) in these critical
areas are <i>Pectoral</i> (Fig.&nbsp;30)
and <i>Inguinal</i> (see Fig.&nbsp;31)
with a third (G, H, I,
Fig.&nbsp;31) which is called
<i>Axillary</i>, and is not constantly
present. The
main muscles involved
in Figs.&nbsp;30, 31 are shown
in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_33">33</a>. The <i>Frontal</i>
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_32">32</a>) is another of the
critical areas, <i>indirectly</i>
concerned in locomo­tion,
and will be considered
first.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Frontal</i> pattern
forms the star on a
horse’s forehead, often
very noticeable when the
hair of it is white. No
detailed descrip­tion is
required if the illustra­tion
of it in Fig.&nbsp;32 be
studied. It is enough to
point out that it lies at or very near the level of the eyes,
sometimes a little above and sometimes a little below this, and
there is occasionally a double whorl, the second lying above the
normal one.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 32<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span> shows the muscles of the fronto-nasal region of the
horse and the manner in which the skin of this central region is
pulled upon in divergent and opposing directions, by a long muscle,<span class="pagenum hide" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
called the <i>Maxillaris</i>, downwards and outwards, by a small thick
muscle, the <i>Corrugator</i>, inwards, by a deeper and more oblique
muscle, the <i>Nasalis</i>, downwards and inwards, and a little more
remotely by the <i>Temporal</i> muscle, and the <i>intrinsic muscles of the
mobile ears</i>. There are thus at least five muscles on each side, all
pulling more or less against one another on this much-disturbed
area of skin. The struggle has been long ago given up and a compromise
arrived at which is registered in the frontal pattern.</p>

<p>Now if anyone doubts whether these comparatively small
muscles act often or strongly enough to produce effects on the hair
over them he need only consult Mr. Roger Pocock’s book to understand
the story of this battle of small forces and its result on the
hair.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 33.—Side view of horse, showing chief superficial muscles.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In his wild state the horse is dependent to a remarkable degree<span class="pagenum hide" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
to his sense of smell for his safety from foes (Pocock), and very
much less so on his sight. Indeed that writer says his range of
good vision is about six yards. At that range his sight is of great
value to him for protec­tion from certain of the dangers of his life,
and we see in a domestic horse to-day the evidence of his past
wild life by his rapid and keen glances at objects at the sides of the
road, both when we ride and drive him. His <i>corrugator</i> muscle
must be almost constantly in action. But his sense of smell is
the sling and stone with which he encounters his Goliaths before
they can get near him, and he ceaselessly expands and draws up his
flexible nostrils employing his <i>nasalis</i> and his <i>maxillaris</i> for snuffing
the air. He has also much useful protec­tion from his sense of
hearing and we all know how those mobile ears of his are hardly
ever at rest, pointing now forwards, now backwards, and again
outwards, as he goes on his way. The degree of these movements
is largely a matter of individual character and breeding. The
case for a conflict of forces in this region is, I submit, fully made
out, and it is easy to see that a radiating pattern of hair, such as
there is in the simple whorl, is only the natural outcome of all this
complex muscular action. The extension of the whorl upwards
in the shape of a feathering which is sufficiently common, indicates
that the struggle has been carried beyond the original battle-field
by the muscles of the ears.</p>

<p>The <i>pectoral</i> (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_30">30</a>) pattern lies over the great fleshy masses
formed by the pectoral muscles, which draw the fore-limbs upwards
and inwards in conjunc­tion with others in the actions of flexion
and extension of these limbs. The patterns, A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C., are wide
expansions of reversed hair beginning in the whorl (A), extending
(B) upwards and terminated in a crest (C). This pattern is, like
the frontal, invariably present in a domestic horse, and is shared
by many other ungulates such as deer and antelopes, as mentioned
in the appendix of a small <span class="nowrap">book<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span>, I published in 1901. But in
none is it so striking or definite as in the horse. The contractions
of these pectoral muscles and their jolt at each step are easily
observed in a trotting horse. It is interesting to compare this
pattern on the horse’s pectoral region with what is found on the
closely allied ass and mule. In the horse it is long and wide and
never absent, and is especially well-developed in high-stepping
horses whether cart-horses or others selected because of their high
action in trotting. Its size, indeed, is a measure of the activity of
the pectoral muscles and flexors of the fore-limb. In the ass it is<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
often absent, and, when it is present, it is rudimentary; in the mule
it is more frequently present than in the ass, but does not approach
the pattern of the horse for size. These degrees of development
in horse, ass and mule correspond closely with the locomotive habits
of the three animals.</p>

<p>The <i>inguinal</i> (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_31">31</a>) pattern is one which the most casual
observer of a horse cannot fail to notice, and it is so graceful in its
shape as to add to the many beauties of its possessor. But in
spite of this no breeder of horses has ever taken this pattern as
one of the “points” of the animal, so that here again selection,
even of the artificial kind, has had no share in its development.
It is but a by-product of the locomotive life of the horse, and a very
ancient character, for it is present in Przewalski’s horse, a probable
ancestor of Equus Caballus. A domestic horse without this pattern
would be a freak of Nature. It occurs in <i>equus hemionus</i>, the
Thibetan wild ass, but not in <i>zebras</i> or in the <i>quagga</i>.</p>

<p>The inguinal pattern deserves rather more descrip­tion than
the two others. It is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_31">31</a> as A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. and the muscles
which produce it and govern its development are shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_33">33</a>.
It starts in a whorl (A) at the fold of skin which passes from the
lower part of the abdomen to the hind limb. This radiates and
expands into a bilateral and symmetrical expansion shaped like
the barbs of a feather. This proceeds upwards in the inguinal
hollow in a direction which curves gently with the concavity forwards,
dividing the trunk of the animal from the great rounded
mass of muscle forming the hind quarters. It extends upwards to
the level of the iliac crest where a projec­tion covered by muscles
can always be recognised, and over this “iliac crest” of the anatomist
it terminates abruptly in a ridge or crest of its own, lying
parallel with the long axis of the trunk. It is very pretty to see
above it the hair-streams from the back of the animal breaking
away like two currents of water on either side of an outstanding
rock, the anterior passing with a wide curve forwards and downwards
along the flank and the hinder one losing itself more gradually in
the original course of the hair-streams of the hind-quarters. No
illustra­tion or verbal descrip­tion gives so good a picture as one
can get from inspec­tion of the smooth coat of any well-developed
domestic horse.</p>

<p>When a few trotting horses are watched by an observer who
bears in mind the accompanying pictures of the muscles and the
inguinal pattern it can be seen at once how all the conditions are
present for fulfilling a gradual change from a primitive slope of
hair to these highly-developed patterns, if he has also followed<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
the conclusion reached in Chapter I. that <i>muscular action can
change the direction of hair in the individual</i>. If at the same time
the degree and extent of the jolt which occurs here at every step
be noted, it is seen to be sharply limited to the area covered by
this pattern, and ceasing, as it does, abruptly and significantly at
the level of the iliac crest. The forward range of the jolt, easily
seen in a thin horse, is much wider than the backward, and marks
out very closely the extent of the forward curve taken by the
anterior hair-stream as it descends from the crest. One may also
remark that there is a small but interesting point which one can
see during or after a shower of rain, for then the flank of a horse
presents a curious distribu­tion of the moisture. At the very point
where the forward stream joins the main stream from the thorax
and abdomen a definite line of darker moist hair is to be seen and
the moist-looking surface is limited to the stream of the trunk and
separated from that of the flank. This line of demarca­tion clearly
indicates the place where the <i>forward jolt</i> terminates during rapid
movement.</p>


<h3>The Domestic Ass and Mule.</h3>

<p>There are two closely related animals, the domestic ass and
the mule, which ought to show this inguinal pattern if affinity and
variation could be fairly invoked to account for it on the theory
of selection. These are also animals whose mode of life is locomotive,
but in a much less degree than the horse and their paces
are quieter and less free in character. What then is found in them
as to the size or persistence of this pattern? In the ass it is absent
or nearly so (I have found one example of its presence), and in the
mule it is variable and never occupies more than half the area of
that in the horse. These facts agree closely with the hybrid
character of the mule and the differing activities of the horse, mule
and ass. The pattern in Przewalski’s horse is small and oval and
resembles that of the mule. The <i>onager</i> (<i>equus asinus</i>), which
is very much like these three domestic animals in form, has an
inguinal pattern, much less in size indeed than that of the horse,
but well-defined, and this fact is in keeping with its character for
remarkable fleetness of foot and activity. The three zebras,
Mountain, Grevy’s and Burchell’s, show no inguinal pattern, in
spite of their <i>power</i> of rapid locomo­tion and resemblance in size
and form to the horse. Though they have that power they exercise
it in their wild lives for their own sakes alone, in the intermittent
way which is bound up with their habit of life, and not for the sake
of man, as in the case of the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span></p>

<p>The pectoral and inguinal regions of the domestic horse are
two of the most valuable fields in the mammalian body for studying
the formation by muscular action of patterns of hair, for this
animal is the locomotive animal <i>par excellence</i>. Here the process
has been carried to the extreme limit, and these two are prominent
examples among the characters to which I drew attention in a
paper published in the <i>Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</i>,
“On proposed additions to the accepted systematic characters of
certain Mammals,” June 9th, 1904, Vol.&nbsp;I. I am still of the opinion
that they deserve “Flag rank,” though they have not yet been
promoted. Be that as it may I think it may be well here to compare
two animals belonging to the family Equidæ, the horse and zebra,
which resemble one another very closely in form—in respect of
these patterns.</p>


<h3>Horse and Zebra Compared.</h3>

<p>If a horse of the hackney type and a zebra were skinned and
the bodies of the two animals then examined I suppose a competent
anatomist would find some difficulty in distinguishing one from
the other so closely do these two allied species of equidæ, one
wild and the other domesticated, resemble one another in structure.
But in this as in many other questions <i>form</i> is not to be considered
alone. The coloura­tion of the two animals is strikingly different,
but, in its humble way, the difference of their patterns of hair-arrangement
is worthy of notice. The horse in different specimens
chosen from a large group will exhibit patterns in the frontal,
pectoral and inguinal regions constantly, and variably in less common
regions, axillary, cervical and gluteal, that is to say, in six different
areas. I have examined many zebras, living and dead, and find no
constant pattern in the whole of its large surface of skin except an
ill-developed frontal and a very small cervical one—<i>two in all</i>.
The mere numerical difference is not the only important one,
for the insignificance of the size of the two zebra patterns and the
constancy and high development of many of those of the horse
are not less significant from the present point of view. I submit
that these two animals carry about with them on their hairy coats
indubitable records of their personal and ancestral habits. Attention
to the facts of a horse’s life and certain related and contrasted
facts of the lives of other animals, of which the zebra may be taken
as a type, will show the reasons why these patterns are to be looked
upon as registers of long-past and present activities of the species
concerned. The horse has been developed out of a wild plastic
stock with some such ancestors as the wild horse of Przewalski,<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
lately brought to Europe, by a process of selection by man during
a thousand generations, first in its Central Asian cradle and later
all over the civilized world. It has been as much <i>made by man</i>
for his purposes in locomo­tion as a locomotive engine has been made
by him. The one has been produced in accordance with the laws of
applied physics and the other by those of biology. His locomotive
life has come to pass for the needs of higher, or at any rate more
cunning creatures, who have availed themselves of the potentialities
provided by Nature. The zebra in its habits differs from the horse
in the simple, but fundamental point that the former lives the
ordinary active life of a wild animal for its own needs of protec­tion
against foes and search for food, the latter has not only this activity
of life in its organisa­tion, but has, super-added to it by domestica­tion,
all the locomotive life of a beast of burden. The zebra presents
few, if any, of those phenomena which I have often termed Animal
Pedometers<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> so characteristic of the hairy coat of the horse
I am reverting here again to the region of metaphor for which I
offer no excuse, but only a few remarks as to the use and value of
that elusive method of illustra­tion. Metaphor is a figure of speech
or writing which consists in a transference of thought from one
idea to another. It is, therefore, not a simple substitu­tion of
synonymous expressions, nor is it merely a simile. It is in hourly
use in the speech and writing of common as well as highly educated
persons, and adds much to the ease of communica­tion among us
of our thoughts upon subjects which rise somewhat above the level
of mere statement of obvious facts. So long as metaphors are not
abused by being used as arguments to prove some proposi­tion,
but only as illustrations of our meaning, we gain greatly by their
legitimate use. It is not for nothing the well-drilled Press of
Germany in their journals and its histrionic Emperor in his rhetorical
outbursts, make extensive use of metaphors. We are everlastingly
reading of Germany’s “biological necessity,” her “iron will to
victory,” the “steel ring of field-grey heroes who guard her against
a world of devils,” of her “brilliant second,” her “granite walls,”
her “future on the water,” the “Admiral of the Atlantic,” “grasping
the trident,” and so on in nearly every public utterance of her
leaders. They know well their audience and employ these harmless,
if often ridiculous, expressions with a definite and legitimate
purpose, and are well qualified for creating the public opinion of a
nation that dearly loves a phrase.</p>

<p>Well, this term, Animal Pedometers, is used here not for proving
anything, but for the purpose of impressing on the mind of the<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
reader the fact of certain patterns on the horse’s skin being intimately
related to its locomotive life which, I hope I may assume, has
been sufficiently demonstrated in this chapter. A pedometer is
one of those works of men devised for his physical and mental
advancement which are marked by a precision as well as purpose
often absent from Nature’s handiwork. Just as a pedestrian,
cyclist, or motorist carries with him his pedometer and tells you
with some pride the number of miles he has “done” in a day or
hour, so the horse displays <i>urbé et orbi</i> his rougher registers of the
locomotive triumphs of his ancestors and himself, and these I call
Animal Pedometers by way of metaphor, and patterns by way of
fact.</p>

<p>The less striking and rarer patterns of the horse’s hair have
been fully described elsewhere<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> and it would serve no useful end
to refer to them at length, nor to multiply proofs of the position

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

HABITS AND HAIR OF UNGULATES.</h2>


<h3>Oxen.</h3>

<p>The even-toed section of hoofed animals is a much larger group
than the odd-toed, and the difference may be illustrated by looking
at the great work on Natural History by Lydekker. There are
273 pages given up to this group and only 112 to the odd-toed,
and when we remember that there are contained in it the hippopotamus,
all the pigs, oxen, sheep, goats, antelopes, camels, llamas,
giraffes and deer, we can see that Lydekker was well justified in
the great amount of space devoted to them. But we all have our
different forms of <i>penchant</i>, and I propose to say very much less
about this section than about the other represented by the domestic
horse. It is well to claim the shelter of a great name in such an
apportionment of interest, and Professor Poulton has given a
clear precedent in his great book called <i>Essays on Evolution</i>. It
contains 393 pages and even though the subject of the work is
Evolution, he has given up 330 pages approximately, or five-sixths,
of his space to insects. This can be gathered from a rough analysis
of his various essays, and no one need blame a great biologist for
having a <i>penchant</i> for the subject he knows best, or a small one for
writing of that he knows a little.</p>

<p>The reason that the even-toed ungulates require less study
from the present point of view is that they are so much more
marked by the normal or primitive slope of hair than the previous
group of Chapter IX. They demonstrate very widely and
thoroughly the empire of the primitive or “barbarian” forces and
so far are valuable witnesses of the negative kind. No case can
well be proved to satisfac­tion by a large series of negatives, and this
was the hopeless task Weismann set out to prove, when he staked
his all on the non-inheritance of acquired characters—and failed.
But negative evidence is of great value in supporting an hypothesis
when it is found to be the precise complement to extensive positive
evidence brought in favour of that hypothesis. That is the case
in regard to the patterns of hair found on oxen, sheep, antelopes,
gazelles and deer, to say nothing of hippopotami, pigs and llamas.
There are some of these patterns described in the previous group<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
which appear in this larger one, but for size, persistence and frequency
they cannot be compared to those of the horse, who has, if I may
so say, inherited all the family property in his own person and
added to it.</p>

<p>The variations in the present group are fully dealt with in
the two earlier books already quoted<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span><span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span>, and I will not complicate
this chapter by any further remarks on them.</p>


<h3>Oxen.</h3>

<p>Of the numerous divisions of even-toed ungulates the oxen
present the best cases for study of the various ways in which the
hair is disposed, and among them the best as well as the most
accessible is the domestic ox. Again we have a familiar friend
of man and innumerable specimens for examina­tion as in the case
of the horse. So this chapter will, like the preceding one, resolve
itself into the study of one typical animal, with whose habits of
life we are intimately acquainted.</p>

<p>Before describing the habits and hair of the domestic ox or
cow, I would like to point out why I value so highly the negative
evidence which consists in the comparative rarity of whorls, featherings
and crests in even-toed ungulates. This brings us back to
the general fact of the <i>raison d’être</i> of the horse and his group on
the one hand, and the ox and his numerous relatives on the other.
There are deer, antelopes and gazelles which for a spurt would
beat any horse and even the Thibetan wild ass, so I am not trying
here to disparage the power of this graceful swift group in the matter
of sprinting. But this term, however colloquial it may be, clearly
marks off the powers and habits of deer, antelopes and gazelles
from those of the horse, for, except when trying to escape from an
enemy, no deer, antelope or gazelle is fool enough to sprint or even
trot for mere pleasure or want of occupa­tion, and certainly not in
the service of man. Thus it comes to pass that animal pedometers
are few and small in this second group of ungulates, and I submit
this negative fact gives strong support to the views advanced
throughout this volume.</p>


<h3>A Cow’s Habits.</h3>

<p>A cow is a very restful animal except when disturbed by
extraneous causes, and the active habits of her life are of little
interest here, the chief importance of her for study being the passive
side of her life or small minor tricks. As a domestic animal she<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
lives to eat—and be eaten and drunk—but her wild ancestors
and relatives have had far from an easy life, though this (in them
even) has not expressed itself in animal pedometers. But on her
neck, back, flanks, legs and haunches the cow has some interesting
specimens of areas where the normal hair-slope is reversed in
accordance with her habits.</p>

<p>The most striking of these is shown in Figs.&nbsp;34 and 35, where
the bare form of the animal is shown and the dark thick arrows
are made paramount in order to make the remarkable arrangement
of her hair along the back so clear, that little verbal descrip­tion is
needed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Figs.&nbsp;34 and 35.</p>

<p>(<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>) Side view of cow, showing arrangement of hair-streams on the back.
(<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) View of back of cow, showing the same.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Behind the level of the horns the normal or backward slope
proceeds until the middle of the length of the neck is reached,
when it encounters transversely a sharp upstanding crest and
beyond this the hair is directly reversed from a point over the<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
shoulders, and here a whorl is found. From this point the stream
returns to its ancient and normal course and so passes to the tail.
When the base of the tail is reached a very significant and apparently
whimsical arrangement of the hair down the centre of the tail is
observed. This consists in a line of stiff hairs which stand up at
right angles to the surface of the tail, and it gradually passes into
the normal again when the more muscular part of the tail is passed.
I should add here that the crest and reversed hair on the back are
common to many wild ungulates of this ruminant group, and a
good example of it is seen in an antelope, Oryx Beisa, which I
figured and described in a paper at the Zoological Society of
London.</p>

<p>Arrangements of its hair so audacious as these need explana­tion,
and it is found in the mode of life of the cow. So large a part of
its daily life is spent in the business of grazing with her muzzle
close to the ground, during which the neck of the animal is constantly
stretched downwards from the back at the level of the shoulders,
that the skin, which is very loose in this and most other portions
of its body, is dragged upon to allow of the extreme flexion of its
neck. This traction is for all this time acting against the normal
or backward slope of the hairs, and has given rise to this victory
of a new force through a thousand generations. It is equally
clear that a mechanical explana­tion of the line of erect hairs on the
first nine or twelve inches of the tail is forthcoming, for one has only
to watch a cow standing on a hot day, undergoing her torment
of flies, to see it writ large. Very strong little muscles are found
at the base of the tail, those along the more free portion becoming
smaller and smaller until they disappear towards the tip. These
give a powerful flicking action to the long heavy tail and I once
made some observations as to this on a number of cows which
were grazing in summer on a comparatively cool wind-swept hillside
in the western end of the Isle of Wight. I watched several cows
on different occasions and found that one would flick her tail 348
times and another 1082 times per hour. Giving these cows an
eight hours’ working day, “working” for their living in grazing
and ruminating by turns, one gains a vivid idea of the number of
times per diem these powerful muscles of the tail contract. If we
call it a day of four hours of grazing and four of ruminating, for
the sake of argument, we get 1392 to 4328 flicks of the tail each day
in the time of flies, leaving out of account the casual flicks in which
she would indulge when flies were not tormenting her. It is hardly
necessary to point out how the underlying muscles would drag
upon the skin of the tail over them and gradually reverse more or<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
less the “lie” of the hairs. They have not formed into a feathering
or complete reversal, but have come near to it.</p>

<p>Further down the haunches of the cow there is on each side
at the back of the thigh a curving reversed area of hair which
turns upwards and towards the middle line. This is the place
where the tail as it swings from side to side sweeps over the limb
and brushes upwards the hair of the thigh towards which it is
swinging. So that the activity of the tail is responsible for another
of the patterns in which the cow’s hair is arranged.</p>

<p>The lower segment of the hind leg exhibits one more reversed
area of hair due to the cow’s habit of lying on the ground slightly
inclined to one side, for the more comfortable disposing of her
limbs, the effect of this attitude being seen in the manner in which
the hair on the back of the leg turns inwards.</p>

<p>On the dewlaps and flanks are certain variable curls and turns
of hair produced by the frequent twitchings of a muscle situated
just under the skin called the “Fly Shaker” or <i>panniculus carnosus</i>.
This muscle is seen any day in the carcase of an ox hanging up in a
butcher’s shop, and it is interesting to notice the fact that it is
distributed over only the lower half of the flank, for the purpose
of shaking off flies from a region which the tail does not reach
efficiently. None of this sheet of muscle is found within the
effective range of the cow’s light artillery, as on the haunches or
hinder portion of the spine. This sums up the equipment of
patterns of hair on the species of this group of ungulates, which is
more adorned with them than any I have examined, and it will be
admitted that compared with those of the horse, it is a poor exhibi­tion,
but one which it is easy to understand if the fundamental
principles of this inquiry are kept in mind.</p>


<h3>Light Occupations of the Cow.</h3>

<p>I watched lately a little act of this drama among a herd of
cows on the Stray at Harrogate during a hot day. There were
105 of them and this was what they were doing all day—some were
browsing with their muzzles close to the ground, their necks making
a considerable angle with the line of their trunks, others standing
stock still with their heads raised at a level with the body, gazing
vacantly into space, others lying on the grass more advanced in
the strenuous work of their day, ruminating with head level, also
gazing at nothing in particular, with their bodies gently rolled to
one side, their fore legs doubled straight under them and their
hind legs planted to one or other side, and a fourth group still
nearer the end of the cycle of work, lying with their chins resting<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
on the ground. When this cycle was completed the stages would
again be begun, continued and ended. They were flapping their
wide ears in various directions, and twitching endlessly the skin
of the flanks and dewlaps with their fly shakers. This large group
afforded, if one may so describe it, a cinematographic picture of
the lives of countless generations of this conservative animal.
Conservative as she is, I doubt not that in the long-past ages her
quiet though persistent habits had once a battle to wage for the
produc­tion of even these mild innovations that I have described.
These present fashions must have been well developed three thousand
five hundred years ago and have adorned that “calf, tender and
good,” which Abraham in the plains of Mamre fetched for the
midday meal of his visitors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

HABITS AND HAIR OF CARNIVORES.</h2>


<h3>Cats.</h3>

<p>Another large and important order of hair-clad mammals must
now be considered, and the same course as in the case of the ungulates
will be followed; the two leading families of Felidæ and
Canidæ will be taken, and a type of each examined in reference
to its hair-distribu­tion. Lydekker gives about 100 pages to the
cats and 80 to the dogs, so from the point of view of general biology
there seems little to choose between them. The bears, racoons,
weasel tribe, seals and walruses may be put out of account. They
are painfully old-fashioned or Normal as to the arrangement of
their hair.</p>

<p>First things first is always a good rule, and there is little doubt
where we ought to begin among the families and species Carnivores.
Among Felidæ one cannot unfortunately choose the harmless
necessary cat of tiles, areas, firesides and ladies’ laps, to say nothing
of those lovers of cats like Huxley who would never eject his cat
from his armchair if she had been there before him. It is true
that we know much of her daily and nightly mode of life—many
of us too much—and in that respect one could set to work with
confidence in interpreting her hair patterns, but on account of
her long and thick coat we can only speculate what patterns or
innovations of her family uniform she might have devised; but
here we are not concerned with romance or the “might have beens.”
It will be remarked that one perforce unconsciously calls the
domestic cat “she” as sailors do their ships. I understand that
in Somersetshire they call everything of their common life “he”
except the tom-cat who is always “she.” The reasons for the use
of genders in different creatures would be an interesting little study.</p>


<h3>Lion.</h3>

<p>The King of Beasts will, therefore, be the hero of this chapter.
Lydekker tells us that the lion, like many heroes of antiquity
who are no heroes to their valets, in spite of his character for
grandeur, nobility and courage, has been subjected to the merciless
higher criticism of modern travellers, Selous, Livingstone, and others,<span class="pagenum hide" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
and he has been shown up as cowardly by nature and mean in
his general conduct. It remains for some learned scholar to
whitewash the hyæna, as someone has done for Caesar Borgia,
and to put him in the place of the lion. But Lydekker does not
admit that this disparagement of the lion goes very far. He <i>is</i>
the King of Beasts by grandeur of appearance, strength and ferocity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 625px;">
<a id="Fig_36"></a>
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="625" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 36.—Lioness, showing by arrows the direction of hair-streams on muzzle, parting from one another
at the level of the orbits.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The lion’s skin is covered by close fine hair, except in certain
seasons in cold climates, and is easily studied. There are three
regions where this representative cat has departed from the Primitive
mammalian slope of hair, and the figure of a lioness shows two of
these, the peculiar <i>downward</i> trend of hair on the muzzle and the
whorl on the shoulder. Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_37">37</a> shows the third, A C, on the middle
of the back as well as the whorls at D.</p>


<h3>Snout of the Cats</h3>

<p>The muzzle of all the cats is very short and broad, and at the
level of the orbits shows a peculiar reversal of the hair from the
rest of the head, for instead of being like that of a dog in which the
hair slopes all the way <i>upwards</i> from the tip of the snout to the
rest of the head, it breaks away from this normal type and passes
in a uniform close stream to the edge of the wet muzzle. The
arrows in Fig.&nbsp;36 show this change. One asks at once the reason
for such an unexpected trend of the hair on a small area, when the
carnivores in other groups have a uniform slope towards the head
from their more pointed muzzles. The cats have discarded the
earlier family pattern and for a reason which does credit to their
self-respect. Very few naturalists know, or have described so well
the meticulous care which animals take of their coats, as Miss
Frances Pitt did in the <i>National Review</i>, where she gave a delightful
account of “How Animals Clean Themselves.” The toilet of the
lion she did not discuss, perhaps for prudential reasons. Her
account dealt chiefly with a number of small hairy mammals and
lower forms of life. Watch a dog cleaning his coat and you will
see the ingenious way in which he pushes his head and body forward
as he lies on some rough surface such as grass, or our best drawing-room
mat. <i>He</i> can thus clean his snout and other parts, but no
cat adopts so rough and ready a method. We know how long and
how scrupulously she licks her fur to clean it in the parts she can
reach and cleans her head with her paws. But with such a broad
snout as she and the larger cats possess she cannot clean the short
surface of it in the manner of the dog. So she “dresses” this
little surface in a special way of rubbing it from the neighbourhood
of her eyes <i>forward</i> with her paws. And so we may assume does<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
the chieftain of her clan finish off this little bit of his toilet. We
are so much accustomed to dwell on the naturally clean habits
of a domestic cat that without such an account as Miss Frances
Pitt has given we should have hesitated to transfer the character
for personal cleanliness from the domesticated to the wild cat. If
this be not the sole reason for the course of the hair-stream I have
described, I am at a loss
to imagine any other.</p>


<h3>Lion’s Neck.</h3>

<p>On each side of the lion’s
neck where it joins the
shoulder there is a well-developed
whorl, and this as
a rule is extended forwards
into a feathering (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_36">36</a>
and 37), and ends in a crest
on the lower part of the side
of the neck. It is common
also in tigers and leopards.
This is, as elsewhere, a
record of strong and oft-repeated
action in powerful
muscles which lie beneath
it, and bears witness to the
great functional activity of
the fore-limbs as compared
with the hind-limbs in these
three formidable cats. It
is not an animal pedometer,
but may perhaps be termed
an <i>ergograph</i>.</p>


<h3>Lion’s Back.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 270px;">
<a id="Fig_37"></a>
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" height="497" width="270" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 37.—Back of Lion, showing
reversed area of hair with whorl
at A. Feather­ing B. Crest C.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The strange pattern of
reversed hair (Fig.&nbsp;37) is
much the most notable of
the three peculiarities found on the lion’s skin. It consists
of a whorl (A) lying over the lumbar region in the middle
line which expands into a very broad feathering (B) and terminates
in a crest (C) a short distance behind the level of the shoulders.
This is not found in any of the numerous short-haired Felidæ that
I have examined, and it is a feature which demands explana­tion.<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
I know no other mammal, ungulate or carnivore, that has any
pattern resembling this; indeed, if one were to photograph the
pattern in question and a few inches of the skin surrounding it,
and be told that it came from the back of a mammal one could not
doubt that it was a hall-mark of the King of Beasts. It would
not produce that thrill of intense interest which we felt at the
meeting on 7th May, 1901, at the Zoological Society of London,
when from a water colour sketch and three pieces of skin taken
from the body of a hitherto unknown mammal, Sir Harry Johnston
proceeded to reconstruct the Okapi, at first dubbed knight, as a
member of the Equidæ, but later promoted downwards to the
Giraffidæ. But one could do no less, with some knowledge of
the hair of mammals, than reconstruct from such a photograph a
large, powerful and ferocious carnivore, and where but in the lion
can the greatest example of those attributes be found? I say
this advisedly, for this remarkable pattern of the lion’s back is as
much a stamp of his moral or mental quality as the Inguinal Pedometer
is of the locomotive <i>rôle</i> in life of <i>equus caballus</i>.</p>

<p>I hear the sharp voice of the critic here, “Come, come, you
may have shown reason for the latter, but how on earth do mental
and moral qualities of an animal come into your scheme?” Well,
we have in this pattern of the lion’s back to deal with a unique
phenomenon for the produc­tion of which neither pressure, nor
friction, nor gravita­tion, nor underlying muscular traction will
account. Nevertheless, it is a result of muscular action of a rare
kind. Who does not know the striking appearance of the hair
along the centre of a short-haired dog when he bristles up with
rage or fear, or both combined, at the sight of a foe? This common
event has its own mechanical cause, though it is one strictly governed
by the mental and moral qualities of the dog, and we see the vivid
proof before us of the action of the minute <i>arrectores pili</i>, in this
particular region of the dog. It is precisely in the same situation
that the special pattern of the lion’s hair is found. It is not for
nothing that Nature has provided every tiny hair of the mammalian
skin with that insignificant little band of muscle which lies within
the hair-pit, and is attached to the sloping hair on its posterior side,
and thus when it contracts serves to drag it into an erect position.
I refrain from discussing what may be held to be the survival value,
under the theory of selection, of this power of the <i>arrectores pili</i>
to confer on the possessor an added appearance of ferocity and
general frightfulness. This is quite a likely explana­tion of the
presence of these little muscles. Be that as it may the <i>modus
operandi</i> of the reversed hair which has become fixed on the lio<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>n’s
back is made clear, theory of origin apart. And I submit that
the presence of it in this region in this animal <i>is</i> a stamp of his
persistently ferocious nature, as much as the various peculiarities
of arrangement of hair on man’s eyebrows in a previous chapter
are of the mental and moral habits of the individual man. As
rulers of old used, in their genial fashion, to brand a supposed or
actual criminal on his shoulder or forehead, so is the lion branded
with an hereditary mark of his nature and the past life of himself
and his ancestors. I doubt not that if short-haired terriers were
living a wild life among numerous foes their bristling hair would
have become fixed in a similar fashion. I would only here draw
the attention of the reader to the fact that this reversed area of
hair on the lion’s back cannot be held to add to the general frightfulness
of the possessor. It would be invisible to an approaching
foe, as it lies hidden behind the great head and mane. This
pattern on the lion’s back will be referred to later in a somewhat
different connec­tion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

HABITS AND HAIR OF CARNIVORES.</h2>


<h3>Dogs.</h3>

<p>Among the canidæ one is able to select a type with whose habits
of life we are more familiar than any other, Canis Familiaris, as
he is affectionately called, the companion of man his master, and
faithful guardian—often unto death. Professor Scott Elliott
gives reason to think that the dog was the first animal tamed by
man, and that he was descended from some wild jackal-like form,
probably crossed by the wolf. The dog is then aptly called by
Huxley, the brother of the wolf, who has been changed by the
intelligence of man into the guardian of the flock. It seems that
in his rudimentary stage of domestica­tion he was an unofficial
scavenger among the habitations of neolithic man, as the pariah
is in the East to-day, and that little acts of kindness towards his
offspring on the part of those early men and women were the first
dawnings of a friendship of thousands of years. It is a long story
from the slinking jackal to the bloodhound, mastiff, St. Bernard,
staghound, collie and terrier of to-day, and one which reflects
much credit on both parties to this friendship, just as do those other
long friendships between servant and master, of which we still see
a few examples. Living with us as he does the dog and his habits
of life are an open book: he is then all the better for my humble
purpose here. I would refer again to the curious use of the gender
which we unconsciously apply to the dog. It is no longer “she,”
but “he.” When a dog is looking a little unfriendly how we
always try to wheedle him with “Poor old fellow,” and so on,
as a matter of course, assuming his masculine character. James
Payn pointed out once a little point which proves how good a
comrade we have in the dog, when he reminds us of the cautious
approach we usually make to a cat, and the “hail-fellow-well-met”
tone we adopt towards the dog, rolling him over and using kindly
opprobrious terms, such as friends among schoolboys hurl at one
another when they are on the best of terms. A fox-terrier is,
perhaps, the most human of all the numerous types evolved through
the skill of man, and it is a smooth-coated specimen of this variety
which I will examine now as to what his hairy coat can tell us of
his habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>


<h3>Some of the Dog’s Habits.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 320px;">
<a id="Fig_38"></a>
<img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" height="506" width="320" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 38.—Gluteal region of dog,
show­ing whorls over the tu­ber­os­ities of the ischia.</p></div>
</div>

<p>His attitudes which bear on this question are all of the passive
order. His locomo­tion is so fitful and different from that of the
horse that we shall find on his coat no animal pedometers.</p>

<p>His passive attitudes consist of standing, sitting and lying.
He stands little, sits more, and lies for a great part of each day.
The standing habit has, of course, no influence upon his hair.
In sitting he rests the chief weight of his body on the rounded,
bursa-covered surfaces of his tuberosities of the ischium, in which
there is nothing peculiar to himself. His fore legs are planted
nearly upright on the ground and his hind legs doubled under him<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
or projecting slightly to one or other side, as we saw in the case of
the cow. The fore legs are obviously in no way affected as to the
direction of the hair in the sitting posture, and the hind legs, being
doubled up and subject to the direct downward weight of the body,
are also free from the <i>sliding pressure</i>, which we shall see affects
the fore limb when the dog lies prone. Thus of the three supports,
fore legs, hind legs and tuberosities of the ischium, two are necessarily
unaffected in their patterns of hair. The anatomical conditions
of his tuberosities are very different in this respect. They are
covered with a large slippery bursa just beneath the thick skin,
and the slightest movement of this alert and restless animal, even
of his head, conveys to this region a small change of position. He is
virtually like a sick person on a water or air cushion, and we all
know how very small movements of the body are felt in a slight
stirring of the supported parts by these. The effect of this is that
the hair over these bursæ is seldom at rest from external or extraneous
forces, to say nothing of its own imperious constant growth
of one inch in two months. In Fig.&nbsp;38 one sees the hair-stream
curving round the buttocks towards the region of these bursæ,
and trying to reach the middle line. It meets with so much
opposi­tion that the very conditions for producing a reversed area
are present and the result is just what one would expect to find.
The pattern is formed exactly over the bursæ limited to this area,
and it does not expand anywhere because there is no need for it to
do so. So when one observes on the surface just below the tail a
pattern, often in a black-and-tan terrier marked by a tan patch of
hair, one reads the record of the long time spent by the dog in
sitting as he meditates on some fresh or past escapade of “A Dog’s
Day.”</p>

<p>The statement just made that the hind leg does not share in
the effects of pressure is not strictly correct; it applies to the <i>leg</i>
properly so called. But the upper part of the thigh exhibits a
very clear reversal of hair due to the weight of the body acting here
against the streams from the side of the thigh, which are seen
endeavouring to make their way to the inner side. They are
arrested by a long ridge of hair which marks the obstacle presented
by the weight of the body acting here. This completes the story
of the way in which sitting affects the hair of the dog, and is
shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_38">38</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>There are four attitudes adopted by the dog in lying. In
the first, when he sleeps he lies stretched out on his side on<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
some surface, with his limbs projected nearly straight out, and
in the second, he curls himself up in <i>his</i> armchair in a cosy, rounded
posture. But in both these attitudes there is no such sliding
pressure as will affect in any way the direction of his hair. In
two other favourite attitudes it is far otherwise. When he lies
prone he plants his fore limbs out before his chest and either raises
his head to the level of his trunk or rests it on his fore paws. Each<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
of these attitudes contributes to a very well-marked change of
the hair on the under surface of his fore arms, to use a convenient
human term, one which carries us back to the story of man and the
apes when their fore arms were discussed. On this surface, from
the mechanical conditions involved, a new force, that of <i>sliding
pressure</i>, comes into play. The skin here is very loose, as indeed
it is in the greater part of his body, which may almost be said to
form one large subcutaneous bursa. The weight of the fore part
of his body and head acts <i>downwards and forwards</i>, and thus opposes
the normal or downward course of the hair on the limb, such as
one sees on the upper surface of his fore arm. The resultant of
these two forces has the effect of acting against the normal slope,
and a reversed direction of the hair is produced very much like
that which is seen in many monkeys and in a small area in man.
This is shown in Fig.&nbsp;39, which appeared in the small <span class="nowrap">book<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span>, to
which reference has been made, and it is confined to the part of
the limb where the sliding pressure is seen to act. In this feature
again there is a record of his resting habits, and, of course, the time
he spends in the fourth attitude with his chin resting on his fore paws
contributes its share, the mechanical conditions being similar.</p>

<p>This fourth attitude brings in another force of its own towards
the “make-up” of the dog’s patterns of hair. When lying with
his head supported on his paws the lower part of his chest is closely
applied to the upper or flexor surface of the fore legs, and the long-continued
pressure of the latter against the downward or normal
streams of hair on the chest leads to its slope being reversed. This
is shown in two wide patterns of the whorl, feathering and crest,
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_40">40</a>, resembling closely the corresponding patterns on the
chest of a horse. I had the opportunity many years ago of examining
in the Capitol Museum at Rome two fine sculptures of Molossian
hounds, when these matters of hair-arrangement were occupying
my attention, and was much struck with the fidelity with which
the ancient sculptor reproduced such small facts as the reversed
areas of hair in a dog. Phiz himself was not more true to Nature
in his delinea­tion of the projecting hairs on the human eyebrows.
It should be added that the reversed hair in question occupies
only that part of the chest which is in contact with the fore limb.
If one cannot reckon any animal pedometers, to the credit of the
domestic dog I think one may fairly and metaphorically say that
his hairy coat gives an accurate mould of his habits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

HABITS AND HAIR OF PRIMATES.</h2>


<p>In spite of the satires of Swift we may not cavil at the natural
pride which has led man, Homo Sapiens, as he also calls himself,
to confer boldly on himself, and his lineal ancestors at any rate,
the name of Primates. This large and highest group of hair-clad
mammals includes broadly and somewhat loosely lemurs, monkeys,
apes and man. The last has not lost his hairy endowment, though
it is sadly curtailed, and it is well to remember that, except on the
palms of the hands, the soles of the feet and the terminal rows of
phalanges of fingers and toes, man <i>is</i> a hair-clad mammal. Shakespeare
calls him “paragon of animals,” and Huxley “head of the
sentient world,” and no reasonable person will attempt to improve
upon such pregnant tributes to his greatness. I desire only to
adhere that <i>quâ animal</i> he is the best of all for my humble purpose
of historian of the chequered course of the mammalian hair,
better even than the domestic horse. His hair varies from a coat
so fine as to need a lens for the discovery of the separate hairs,
to a truly Simian profusion of thick and long hair such as that of
the Ainu or hairy aborigines of Japan.</p>


<h3>Hair and Habits of Man.</h3>

<p>The streams of his hair demonstrate two important facts
about man: first <i>what he has been</i>; secondly <i>what he has done</i>,
that is to say, his ancestry and habits of life, through an immense
stretch of time. These stories in hair are the culmina­tion of a
large number of characters inherited and acquired, and their study
in two selected regions of lemurs, apes and man will be pursued in
this chapter on the lines which I laid down in Chapter VI.
I have thought it well not to give any connected account of the
rest of his hairy covering so as to concentrate attention on the
two simplest and most striking regions. The charts of his hair-streams
and those of the lemur and ape have been described with
sufficient fulness elsewhere<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> and no cartographer has hitherto
sought to improve upon them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>
<p>The back and the front surfaces of the trunk afford the two
best and most instructive fields of study, for the forces which act
upon them are of a simple kind, and may be traced upwards from
the lemurs to man as in the case of the forearms. The three drawings
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_41">41</a>) represent the backs of a lemur, chimpanzee and man, most
of the details of the hair being omitted and their place taken by
thick dark arrows which show the line of the different hair-streams.
This diagrammatic method will make any misunderstanding of
the main facts impossible.</p>

<p>The lemur has on the back of its neck a forward or headward
slope of hair and this passes on to the head itself, and on the back
of the trunk, as the arrows show, there is no departure from the
normal arrangement of the lower mammals. The lemur, therefore,
requires neither further descrip­tion nor explana­tion.</p>

<p>The ape shows no material change in this region from the
arrangement of its lemur or monkey ancestor, in spite of the greater
propor­tion of its life which is spent in the upright posture; indeed,
this is what one would expect.</p>


<h3>Hair of the Back of Man.</h3>

<p>When the hair on the back of man is examined a remarkable
change from the patterns of any of his known or supposed ancestors
is found. It is by no means easy to trace the course of the hairs
on the human back. A young, hairy and dark-haired person
gives much the best field, and a lens may be necessary. In older
subjects the hair is often so much worn away by friction that the
direction can no longer be followed. Suffice it to say that the
examina­tion, though somewhat difficult, can well be carried out
if the proper conditions are observed; and that it bears out the
results which have come from the corresponding examina­tion of
infants. <i>The arrangement is congenital.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 653px;">
<a id="Fig_41"></a>
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" height="311" width="653" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 41.—Arrangement of hair on the back of lemur—chimpanzee—man.</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the neck the hair passes on each side nearly downwards,
and in the middle directly downwards in a narrow stream between
the two muscular borders of the vertebral furrows, and continues
in this normal direction to the end of the spinal region. It will
be seen that below the two upper arrows there are three levels of
arrows, the first with one, the second with two, and the third with
one, on each side of the surface of the back. At the level of the
shoulder-joints the side-streams curve upwards towards the spine
and join the central stream; at the second the direction is rather
more upwards before it curves inwards and downwards to the
vertebral furrow; at the third the streams curve slightly upwards
and towards the middle-line and coalesce with the other streams.<span class="pagenum hide" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
The contrast between the straight, simple slope of the hair on the
lemur’s and ape’s back, and that of man is very great. In the
latter the side-streams make an angle of 45° or less with the axis
of the spine and <i>this arrangement is unique among mammals</i>. It
will be, therefore, necessary to inquire into its history and causation,
for it goes far towards reversing the well-established and accredited
pattern of apes, monkeys and lemurs. If the reader will carry
his mind back to the arrangement of hair on man’s forearm he will
see that it exhibits some features analogous to those on the back
of man. In the forearm there is that curious little stream on the
extensor surface which may be looked upon as a relic from the
ape-stock, but in the rest of that limb-segment man has boldly
gone back, beyond the ape, to an arrangement found in the lemur;
and in the case of the back of man there is the small primitive
area down the vertebral furrow and an entirely novel arrangement
on each side such as might startle the leaders of animal fashions
in hair.</p>

<p>The question at once arises: “How has this change come to
pass?” In the case of the strange arrangement on man’s forearms
I have shown that the Pan-Selectionist thought he detected there
one of his particular kinds of vestige. He cannot find any such
here. I can conceive a biologist making play with Heredity,
Variation and Selection in the case of an ape, monkey, or lemur
whose hairs are long and thick and functionally very active. <i>There</i>
he might make use of the well-known “argument from ignorance,”
and maintain that we cannot be sure that such and such factors
might not have survival-value, but I defy the most hardy among
the Pan-Selectionist High Command to put in that plea in connec­tion
with the fine short hairs of man which even require a lens for their
detection; they have little value as a protec­tion of the skin from
friction; their arrangement has none. And if some leader did
attempt this task I doubt if the most docile Prussian would not
rebel against the statement that the withdrawal in question was
“according to plan.” My purpose, however, in this book being
to build up and not to pull down, I must perforce show a reasonable
and better explana­tion of a remarkable little fact.</p>


<h3>Passive Habits.</h3>

<p>The habits of man concerned in the <i>modus operandi</i> of this
change are passive, and two in number; that of sitting with his
back against some supporting object, and of lying in sleep with
his head more or less raised on a pillow or its equivalent. In
contrast with man, lemurs and apes inhabit trees during their<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
many hours of rest, and I doubt if the number of hours thus spent
by these and other wild animals to that spent in active exercise is
less than three to one, so that their attitudes of rest would, if
calculated to do so, contribute much towards any change occurring
in the patterns of hair. But, seeing that the ape-fashion is similar
to that of the lemur, and that this normal arrangement is calculated
only to be confirmed by the action of gravity and the dripping
of rain, and that they do not greatly indulge themselves, if at all,
in their equivalent for man’s armchairs, nothing else would be
expected in the hairy covering of their backs than what we find.</p>

<p>The increasing tendency to the upright position in Eoanthropus
Dawsoni and Pithecanthropus Erectus to say nothing of the men
of Cromagnon—led man to use as supports for his back the walls of
his rough caves which he had adopted as dwellings instead of the
branches of trees and the nests of the ape. He no longer affected
entirely those hardy habits of sitting without support for his
back that were <i>de rigueur</i> in his ancestors, who probably looked
upon him with as much disapproval as certain erect old ladies of
the old school display towards the use of easy chairs by the rising
genera­tion. Wearied with the struggle for food, and against his
savage rivals, he rested his back against the sides of his rude abode.
When he slept in this attitude the relaxa­tion of his voluntary
muscles allowed mechanical forces to come into action which tended
to oppose the downward trend of the hair. We know from our
own experience that when sitting asleep with our backs supported
there always occurs a certain amount of sinking down of the trunk.
In this attitude are present, then, such conditions of the back and
its hairy covering as give rise to mechanical forces which would
interfere with the direction of the hair. These are, a heavy body,
tending to slip downwards slightly while resting against a fixed
surface, a growing tissue easily diverted from its normal course,
and many hours spent in the attitude in question.</p>

<p>The effects of these conditions increased with the increasing
tendency of developing man to attend to his bodily comfort.</p>

<p>But man spends also on the average at least a third of his
whole existence lying in sleep with his head on a pillow of some
kind, perhaps the skull of a <i>Felis Groeneveldtii</i> in the case of
Pithecanthropus Erectus, and other such better objects, as he made
more study of the art of being comfortable. Those who know much
of children and sick persons and have watched them in sleep know
that the habit of lying on one or other side prevails largely over
that of lying on the back. The head being more or less raised by a
pillow, the human sleeper, even when lying on his back and more<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
so when lying on his side, is in a potentially and actually sliding
position, a fact well known to most persons from their own
experience. It is easy to see how such conditions are tending for a
third of a man’s whole life to reverse in some degree the direction
of his hair and how they act as we saw in the case of the sitting
posture. But the very common <i>lateral</i> position in sleep contributes
its own peculiar share in pushing the hair towards the spine, ceasing
to do so only when the prominent muscular border of the vertebral
furrow is reached. I think it will escape no careful observer of
these simple facts of man’s resting life, who also notes the remarkable
course of the arrows on his back, that the facts and their present
explana­tion fit one another like a Chubb lock and its key. The
only alternative sugges­tion of the facts is that some being with
diabolic power has been at work and laying a trap for poor human
biologists in the 20th century A.D.</p>

<p>In confirma­tion of this process I would refer to an example
which agrees very closely with the above explana­tion. I knew an
invalid suffering from pleurisy and lung-disease who was much
confined to bed, spending much of his time propped high up on
pillows. He had long dark hair on his back and I was often
struck, when examining him, with the remarkable way in which
the hairs were dragged upon so that they pointed nearly in a
vertical <i>upward</i> direction. Here was a little instance of an
undesigned experiment in the dynamics of hair.</p>


<h3>Hair of the Chest.</h3>

<p>In the hair-streams on the chest of our chosen three, lemur,
ape and man, there are also some remarkable contrasts in the course
they take. Fig.&nbsp;42 shows these in a vivid manner. Precisely
as in the case of the hair on the backs of lemurs, apes and man,
we find on the chest of those three types a normal direction on the
two lower ancestors and an entirely novel arrangement in man;
the former, therefore, will need no verbal descrip­tion.</p>

<p>Man, the ever bold explorer and innovator has initiated on
his chest, as on his back, a fashion in hair unknown in any of the
primates. He is, in respect of his hair on these two regions, <i>sui
generis</i>. On the chest there is a critical area extending across the
sternum at the level of the second rib from a whorl which is found
on each side somewhat above the nipples. This is not less an
ancient battle-field than the Border which separated England and
Scotland, and it has been the site of its little conflicts, more especially
<i>north</i> of the Border, corresponding to those of the wild days of
Border warfare of which Scottish history is full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span></p>

<p>At this level of the chest two streams of hair are <i>directly</i>
opposed to one another. That which covers the chest below the
dividing line maintains in true old English style its conservative
fashion and passes downwards as in the ape and lemur. The
more independent or Scottish stream goes upwards on its way to
the neck, the side streams passing somewhat outwards towards the
side of the neck, the central upwards and inwards, converging
gently on to the front of the neck. The arrows in the figure show
this very clearly. On the front of the neck the stream pursues
its upward way until it meets the downward flowing stream from
the lower jaw, and the <i>junction</i> of these two streams lies over the
level of the upper border of the larynx in front, winding gently
outwards and upwards to the surface just below the lobes of the
ears. The opposi­tion of the two streams in the neck is very familiar,
as a piece of practical experience, to those who shave, for it affords
a decided little resistance to the razor as it is drawn downwards,
and many persons change the position of the razor in consequence
of it, without troubling their heads with any scientific reason
for the fact.</p>

<p>These are the facts of the distribu­tion of hair on man’s chest,
but what is the interpreta­tion? I would remark here that in my
former <span class="nowrap">book<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> I gave what seemed to be then the best reason for
it, but further reflec­tion on the matter has shown me that it was
incorrect and inadequate. I refer to this and one or two other
corrections of earlier views in a later chapter.</p>


<h3>Interpretation of Records.</h3>

<p>In discussing such a striking little fact as the one in question,
an illustra­tion may serve as an introduc­tion. From the glaciers
of Mont St. Gothard two great rivers take their rise. The eastern
side of its slopes gives rise to the Rhine, which flows in a northerly
direction to the Lake of Constance, the western to the Rhone,
whence it pursues a south-westerly course to the Lake of Geneva.
No geographer would doubt that certain physical features of the
country were to be sought in accounting for the contrary courses
of two rivers arising from a comparatively small region, and he
finds it by a simple study of the topography concerned. By similar
methods we must ascertain why from our little Mont St. Gothard
at the level of the second rib, two streams of hair separate and
pursue nearly opposite directions.</p>

<p>A little knowledge of the superficial anatomy of the chest
and neck throws some light at once on the problem. It so happens<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
that if one made a simple map of these hair streams, and at the
side of it a drawing of the platysma myoides muscle, it could not
fail to strike one that the correspondence of the surfaces occupied
by the two phenomena was very significant. It is going too far
to say that the correspondence is complete, but it is so nearly so
that one may fairly say that the reversed stream of hair which
begins at the second rib and goes up the neck, lies over the platysma
muscle. The stream of hair does not extend up to the lower part
of the face and lower jaw, it does not cover the outlying portion
of the platysma on the side of the neck and it begins on the chest
a little above the rather uncertain origin of the platysma fibres
from the fascia of the chest. But the correspondence of its surface
with the main part, or about five-sixths of the platysma, is most
suggestive.</p>

<p>This muscle is one of the subdermal sheets that are found
in many mammals, and though it is not a continua­tion or descendant
of the fly-shaker or panniculus carnosus, which is often referred
to in these pages, it is an analogous feature of man. It is <i>closely
attached</i> at its lower part to the skin over it and more loosely at
its upper. It has various functions attributed to it, as I will
mention later; but there is one effect of its action which is very
evident in a thin person, that is to say, it wrinkles the skin over it
in a vertical direction. This it does, whatever else it may do.</p>


<h3>Struggles of the Platysma.</h3>

<p>In interpreting this novel hair stream of man’s chest and
neck we are again brought into an atmosphere of struggle of forces.
Something has occurred in the course of man’s descent from the
ape to interfere very sharply with the course of the hair; and
certainly if there be anything in organisms that Heredity, Variation
and Selection are unable to do (even when adorned with capital
letters, to make them, as Huxley said, “like grenadiers with bearskins,”
appear much finer fellows than they are), it is to provide
in this reversed stream of hair on man’s chest some cunning
“adapta­tion” to his needs. Selection will not serve; but I think
use and habit will. There can be little, if any, doubt that the
frequent and active contractions of the platysma muscle in the
course of man’s life are the efficient cause of the change of arrangement
of hair from a downward simian to an upward human slope.
To this opinion the anatomist will promptly reply: “Ah! I have
thee there, friend Lamarckian; are there not any number of apes
and monkeys that also have an active and efficient platysma?”
Undoubtedly there are, and I give here, through the kindness of<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
Professor Keith, a short account of that muscle in simiadæ. It
is taken from an unpublished work of his on <i>The Myology of the
Catarrhini—a Study in Evolution</i>. The account may be only
interesting to the professed anatomist, but the conclusions in the
summary bear closely on the present problem. I give the exact
words from Chapter II., pp.&nbsp;472, 479. The simian forms
examined are <i>semnopithecus</i>, <i>gorilla</i>, <i>chimpanzee</i>, <i>orang</i>, <i>gibbon</i>,
<i>macacus</i>, <i>cercopitheci</i>, <i>cynocephali</i>. “<i>Summary</i>: Every gradation
is found between the cynocephalic and human forms. The evolution
lies in the disappearance of the supra-trapezial origin and the
superficial labio-mental insertion. The opposite nuchal and
mental angles of a trapezoidal sheet are obliterated and a rhomboidal
figure is left. The change may be seen step by step through the
<i>macaci</i>, <i>semnopitheci</i>, <i>hylobates</i>, <i>troglodytes</i> and the <i>orang</i> to Man.</p>

<p>“The maxillary insertion in man is more extensive than the
others, and the insertion is more distinctly demarcated from the
quadratus menti origin. But slips between the two muscles are
not uncommon.</p>

<p>“The sub-mental interdigita­tion occurs frequently in man,
and although its extent varies in the other Catarrhini it is always
present.</p>

<p>“The upper nuchal fibres, being cut loose in the higher members
of the orthorachitial group from their primary origin, became
aberrant in their behaviour. Auriculo-labial slips, slips of union
with the zygomatici, or simulating a <i>risorius</i>, or a relapse to the
primitive medial dorsal origin and connec­tion with the occipito-auricular
muscles may occur in man as in the others.</p>

<p>“Fasciculation of the muscle may occur in man and the
<i>troglodytes</i>.</p>

<p>“That the functions of this muscle are indefinite is shown
by the numerous individual and generic variations. But that
its presence is essential may be judged by its persistence. It may
depress the angle of the mouth or the lower jaw, or help to flex
the head upon the chest, or help to empty the laryngeal air-sac
if it be present. But as a matter of fact all these functions are
otherwise provided for. When tense it protects the deep part of
the neck somewhat, and it is usually active in temper. The
axillary part of the same sheet in the <i>cynomorphæ</i> offers a similar
puzzle as regards its functions.”</p>

<p>We have it thus on the highest authority that the platysma
muscle is active and persistent in a large series of monkeys, apes
and man. But the whole work has for its sub-title, “A Study in
Evolution,” and in the story of the platysma there is a picture of<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
its progressive development to that of man. There is evidence
in the above account of the muscle that a structure is found in
monkeys and man which might operate on the overlying streams
of hair in any of these animal forms—or might not—in accordance
with the concep­tion of struggle between opposing forces which I
have kept in view all through this volume.</p>

<p>It is evident that in all animals below man the platysma
has not achieved any victory by its action over the streams of
hair on the chest and neck, and to my mind it is equally evident
that in the case of man it has carried through a very manifest
“turning-movement.” It will be objected, quite properly, that
this is a matter of opinion, and the pertinent question will be asked,
“How do you account for the absence of this reversed hair-pattern
in apes and monkeys and its absence in man, both having an
efficient platysma muscle?”</p>

<p>The essence of a struggle is that it ends with the victory of
one adversary over the other, and as the race is not always to the
swift nor the battle to the strong, there is of necessity some uncertainty
as to the result of any struggle. The factors of time as
well as of overwhelming force are required for most of the victories
of man over man, and it is not less so in the victories of habit
over ancestry in the direction of hair, as I have repeatedly shown.
The required time is clearly at one’s disposal for this victory, and
the “overwhelming force” of habit and use is purely a question
of the degree of repeti­tion and the efficiency of the contractions
of the platysma, and its greater use in man than in apes and monkeys.
The uses to which it was put in the lower forms not having been
sufficiently overwhelming for victory, no change in them has been
shown. The cumulative effects of the actions of a developing
platysma in man, under the guiding influence of his more complex
habits of life, have turned the scale in favour of the reinforced
forces of habit, and the direction of the hair becomes reversed
nearly all over the area covering the muscle.</p>

<p>We must consider all the forces engaged in this struggle for
mastery on the neck and chest of man, and remember on one hand
the power of the normal slope of hair, the greater difficulty of
altering the direction of the thick long hairs of monkeys and apes,
and their relatively long resting hours; and on the other the
shorter and finer hairs of man and the increasing efficiency of his
platysma muscle in varied actions. Professor Keith mentions
four functions of the platysma: that of <i>depressing the angle of the
mouth and lower jaw, helping to flex the head upon the chest</i>, and to
<i>empty the laryngeal air-sac</i>, and <i>protecting the deep parts of the neck<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
when it is tense</i>—adding the significant comment that “it is usually
active in temper”—I presume this to mean bad temper!</p>

<p>Leaving out of account the emptying of the laryngeal air-sac,
is it not evident that the remaining three actions of the platysma
are very much more exerted in the case of man with all the numerous
occupations and movements of his head and neck, in obedience
to his higher brain, than in the apes, monkeys and lemurs, endowed
with a fitful activity, with fewer and less variable movements of
their head, and long, long hours spent in their particular form of
medita­tion?</p>

<p>So, when the muscular sheet, which, as I have said, is <i>closely
attached to the skin of the chest and more loosely to that of the neck</i>,
contracts and becomes shortened between its origin on the chest
to its insertion in the face and jaw, it gives a most obvious pull on
the skin over it and wrinkles it vertically in a manner which will
strike any thin person who contracts it voluntarily before a looking-glass.
The connec­tion shown between the action of the platysma
muscle and the change of hair is so close that it can hardly be
questioned that one is the cause of the other. If it be not proved
to demonstra­tion it is “tremendously probable” and the connec­tion
falls into line with the previous demonstrated cases.</p>

<p>I must add here a remark suggested by the views of man’s
descent put forward since this was written. The claim that man
has changed the direction of his hair on his back and chest by use
and habit owing to altered modes of life is not dependent on the
simian theory of his descent. The change to his present patterns
on those two regions from those of any “active arboreal pioneer”
among insectivores is just as striking and is open to the same line
of explana­tion.</p>

<p>It would serve no useful purpose here to travel further over
the varied streams of hair on the body of man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES.</h2>


<p>In this chapter a few of the rarer examples of hair-clad mammals
which present remarkable changes at critical areas of their hairy
coats may be considered with advantage. I have chosen six, of
which three appeared in my former book.</p>


<h3>The Giraffe.</h3>

<p>The two drawings of a giraffe, Figs.&nbsp;43 and <a href="#Fig_44">44</a> were made for me
for the purpose of illustrating one of its habits and two of its
peculiarities of arrangement of its hair. This stately creature
is the tallest known animal and is the sole representative of its
ancient family, more common in the days when giants abounded.
Its range is becoming more limited and its enemies not less dangerous,
and it is expected in the course of some years to add to the number
of the recently-extinct creatures.</p>


<h3>Habits.</h3>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 43.—Giraffe showing at A and B, hair-patterns of a remark­able kind
at the place where the main move­ments of the neck occur.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Living mainly in dry sandy regions giraffes find their food
exclusively in leaves plucked from trees, and are said by some
authorities to exist for a long period without drinking, but an
interesting account quoted by Lydekker from Selous should be
mentioned here. Selous writes that on a certain occasion he
reached camp “a little before sundown, just in time to see three
tall, graceful giraffes issue from the forest a little distance beyond,
and stalk across the intervening flat, swishing their long tails to
and fro, on their way down to the water. It is a curious sight to
watch these long-legged animals drinking, and one that I have
had several opportunities of enjoying. Though their necks are
long, they are not sufficiently so to enable them to reach the water
without straddling their legs wide apart. In doing this, they
sometimes place one foot in front, and the other as far back as
possible, and then by a series of little jerks widen the distance
between the two, until they succeed in getting their mouths down
to the water; sometimes they sprawl their legs out sideways in a
similar manner.” Lydekker adds that this position has to be<span class="pagenum hide" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
assumed not only when drinking, but likewise when the animal
desires to pick up a leaf from the ground or on the rare occasions
when it grazes. This habit so graphically described is the one
which alone concerns my subject. The patterns of hair peculiar
to the giraffe need a short descrip­tion.</p>


<h3>Hair Patterns.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="Fig_44"></a>
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="" height="496" width="450" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 44.—Giraffe in the act of drink­ing or brows­ing off the ground.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 43 shows a whorl (B) at the side of the neck on a level
with the prominent spines of the seventh cervical and first dorsal
vertebræ. It lies exactly over a spot which may be well called
a “critical area,” for an important hinge of the whole mechanism
of the giraffe’s great neck is situated here. Though the remarkable
length of its neck is intimately associated with its daily needs for<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
protec­tion against enemies and the supply of food from high-placed
branches of trees, it forms a real obstacle to the less important need
of obtaining water to drink or food from the ground as Selous and
Lydekker show. The protective value of the neck is picturesquely
described by Mr. Beddard when he speaks of it as the giraffe’s
watch-tower, whence its keen eyesight surveys the surrounding
country for its enemies. But its attitude in drinking, Fig.&nbsp;44,
gives a vivid idea of the play of forces which takes place at the
great hinge between the neck and the trunk, and at this point the
whorl has been produced on the skin in the course of its laborious
efforts to supply itself with water. The absence of any other whorl
or reversed hair on the whole of its neck and trunk is most significant
from the point of view of the dynamics of hair.</p>

<p>The second departure from the normal direction of hair is
found on the prominent portion of the spine, and it lies over this
hinge-area. In Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_44">44</a> is shown the mane proceeding along the
whole of the neck in the normal downward direction, and the
arrows indicate the way in which it becomes suddenly reversed at
the critical point and the lowest portion of the mane stands up and
points upwards. This change is shown by the two arrows whose
points meet one another, and the facts of its occurrence, here and
nowhere else, at once suggest that the habit which produced the
whorl on the side of the neck has also contributed to the change
in the direction of the mane. The pattern here is precisely of the
same order as that of the cow’s neck which we saw to be caused
by its habit of browsing off the ground.</p>


<h3>Bongo—Tragelaphus euryceros.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 240px;">
<a id="Fig_45"></a>
<img src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" height="498" width="240" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 45.—Bongo. Showing on the
strong mus­cu­lar chest, well-formed
pec­toral pat­terns.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This West African antelope is a forest-dwelling species, about
which little is known as to its habit of life, though its form and
anatomy are well described by Lydekker. It has a powerful chest,
long and strong horns, and short hoofs, and it is shown in Fig.&nbsp;45
with its large pectoral whorl, feathering and crest, in which it
strongly resembles the domestic horse. One may be allowed here,
as exact knowledge is wanting, to point out that “reconstruc­tion”
of its habits may be reasonably attempted along the lines laid down
in these pages. It is doubtful if any large mammal could possess
so powerful a fore-end with very muscular forelimbs, highly-developed
pectoral patterns and short strong hoofs without being a
very fleet animal much accustomed to relying upon its speed for
its protec­tion, and if a greater knowledge of it be obtained in the
future it is highly probable that this predic­tion will be verified.
Part of its habitat is described as the Ashkankolu Mountains, a
region where speed would be of great value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span></p>


<h3>Kiang—Thibetan Wild Ass.</h3>

<p>This member of the Equidæ is shown in Fig.&nbsp;46 and there is
an excellent specimen of it at South Kensington. I have chosen
it because it is very unusual among others of its family in the
possession of an inguinal and axillary whorl, feathering and crest.
No other than the domestic
horse that I have examined
shows these patterns. They
are nearly as well developed
as in the horse, and require
no special descrip­tion. It
lives in high altitudes up to
fourteen thousand feet, and
travels often in large herds,
its food being composed of
the various woody plants of
these dry and barren regions.
Lydekker says that it “is
remarkable for its fleetness
and its capacity for getting
over rough and stony ground
at a great pace.” From these
facts one can gather that a
large portion of its working
day would be spent in rapid
locomo­tion from place to place
in search of its sparse food-supplies
and in avoiding
enemies—two paramount objects
of its existence which
are pictured in the two animal
pedometers displayed on its
hairy coat.</p>

<h3>Llama—L.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 310px;">
<a id="Fig_47"></a>
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="" height="609" width="310" />
<div class="caption"><p class="taj">Fig. 47.—Fore foot of
llama shown from behind
(<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>) and from side (<span class="lowercase smcap">B</span>) with
whorls of hair and reversed
areas on each side.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I refer here to the true
llama or domesticated form of
the genus Llama, of which the vicunha and huanaco are the existing
wild species. In the stirring time when a handful of Spanish
Conquistadores under Pizarro conquered and trampled upon the
ancient civilisa­tion of the Incas this useful animal was employed
to an immense extent as a beast of burden. Lydekker says that
at the time of the Conquest of Peru it was estimated that three<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
hundred thousand llamas were employed in the mines of Potosi
alone. Prescott gives an excellent account of the use of this
animal in his <i>Conquest of Peru</i>. They were valued highly for their
strength and sureness of foot which were much needed in their
long and rugged journeys over the great passes of the Cordilleras,
as well as for the excellence of their flesh.</p>

<p>The only region of a llama’s body which is of interest in the
present inquiry is the fore-foot, figured in Fig.&nbsp;47. It presents a
very remarkable arrangement of hair on its under surface, just
above the double hoof and spongy pad at the joint above the hoof.
This is found on each side towards the outer border of the hollow
region, and consists of a whorl from which the hairs radiate in a
reversed direction towards the upper part and transversely across
the rest of the hollow. Prescott speaks of “its spongy hoof,
armed with a claw or pointed talon to enable it to secure hold on
the ice,” and adds that “it never requires to be shod.” If one
reflects upon the ceaseless action during rough and slippery locomo­tion
of this animal throughout its working life on mountain
passes, on rough stony paths and ice-covered places, one can have
no doubt of the reason why this particular joint, so greatly used in
maintaining a foothold, should have acquired on this sheltered
portion of its hair an animal pedometer.</p>


<h3>The Parti-coloured Bear—Æluropus Melanoleucus.</h3>

<p>This is a rare and peculiar form of the family of Ursidæ about
which I made a statement some years ago at the Zoological Society
of London. It is a “stocky” animal with a small head and broad
short muzzle, a feature to which it has no right according to its
affinities. It is not a member of the high-class Felidæ whose special
prerogative it is to wear their hair on a short broad muzzle in a
<i>downward</i> direction as I showed in Chapter XI. Being a more
<i>bourgeois</i> creature than a cat it has offended against such sumptuary
laws as may exist in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Its hair ought to be worn in the proper backward or upward
slope such as other bears, dogs and small carnivores display.</p>

<p>In my former note I modestly proposed an alternative sugges­tion
to the one I now offer, of this aberrant and strange bit of hair-country,
and this was that it was correlated with the broad short
snout. As I have remarked before this word “correlated” is used
so loosely as to mean almost anything the user likes, and it is, in
my opinion, a fine source of confusion of thought. Undoubtedly
this shape of the muzzle of the Parti-coloured Bear is linked somehow
with the arrangement of its hair on that region. But it is<span class="pagenum hide" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span><span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
hardly to be imagined that a direct reversal of hair from the proper
bear-type, that is to say from the mouth to the head, would be
produced by the mere broadening of the
muzzle on account of some adapta­tion to
its altering life. The link surely is of a
different nature, and analogous to that of
the corresponding surface in the lion and
other cats, and that the cleaning of its
fur on the snout is done in feline and not
in ursine fashion, that
is to say forwards,
and that the breadth
of muzzle is the reason
for the change of
method.</p>


<h3>Two-Toed Sloth—Cholæpus
didactylus.</h3>

<p>This weird creature
is one of a decaying
family whom naturalists,
with needless
and frank brutality,
called toothless. The
term is neither exact
nor polite. It is very
much as if one were
to call a person
“toothless” whose front teeth had been
knocked out, but whose remaining teeth
were good and useful. But it represents
so important a taxonomic character
that one must allow for what seems bad
manners on the part of zoological leaders
who are, as a rule, full of the milk of
human kindness, and seldom in these days
quarrel even among themselves, adopting
the motto <i>nihil animalium alienum a
me puto</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 48.—Two-toed sloth, show­ing action of grav­ity upon the
long thick hairs.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sloths form an excellent example of the action of gravity
upon long thick hairs, and the Fig.&nbsp;48 given will explain this. They
are New World animals, though indeed they have what we call an<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
“Old World” look, and are truly ancient. They spend the larger
part of their time upside down in the manner represented in the
drawings. They are arboreal and nocturnal animals that come
down to earth in search of food when things are quieter below, and
will wander for considerable distances, walking slowly on the outer
borders of their feet and the feet turned in.</p>

<p>These being the few facts of their lives which concern the
present subject one comes, as usual, to interpreta­tion. These tree-sloths
are descended from an older form that inhabited the ground,
so that the present mode of life, which is so largely arboreal, has
been acquired by dint of long years of struggle and adapta­tion to
bitter needs. It seems hardly reasonable to call in the aid of
selection for the produc­tion of its singular disposi­tion of hair though
that factor ruled in the produc­tion of its arboreal habit. It is
almost flying in the face of common sense to attribute this upward, or
downward (according to one’s point of view) singular arrangement
to anything but the effects of gravity upon its long hairs. If it be
not so, it looks a remarkable likely solution of this small problem.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

EXPERIMENTAL.</h2>


<p>About ten years ago I began an investiga­tion into the results
of the applica­tion by man to the domestic horse of various forms
of harness, desiring to find out if these results were capable of being
transmitted from one genera­tion to another. In 1908 I had not
got very far, but thought it well to bring before the Zoological
Society of London the results observed up to that time and read a
paper entitled, “Some observations on the effects of Pressure
upon the Direction of Hair in Mammals.” It was kindly received,
but was not published in their proceedings, as it appeared to the
Publica­tion Committee a paper more suited to “another place,”
presumably those of a veterinary society. It was illustrated by
the two figures I give here of a horse in full harness, and another
with the chief results as to changes of the direction of hair, or new
patterns, displayed on its coat.</p>


<h3>Progress of Inquiry.</h3>

<p>Being disposed to think that the investiga­tion could be carried
further, I proceeded to look about for any examples in horses which
might show the transmission of these artificial results to their
descendants, and had to wait awhile before I could see which of
the regions affected by the pressure of harness were likely to afford
the required phenomena. These were in due time forthcoming,
and will form the chief subject of the present chapter. I look upon
them as cases of an <i>undesigned experiment</i> and will describe them
later.</p>

<p>In the present stage of science all hypotheses must be submitted
to the test of experiment before they can enter the charmed circle
of natural laws. For this reason one must endeavour to apply the
test of experiment to the hypothesis before us.</p>


<h3>The Nature of Experiment.</h3>

<p>Hitherto I have gone no further than the region of experience
and observa­tion, from which, Jevons says, “all knowledge proceeds.”
There has been abundance of observa­tion of phenomena in this<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
quest and I have ventured even on hypothesis. Experiment is
shortly defined by Jevons as <i>observa­tion plus altera­tion of conditions</i>.
He points out that when we make an experiment we more
or less influence the events which we observe, as when we bring
together certain substances under various conditions of temperature,
pressure, electric disturbance or chemical action and so on, and then
record the changes observed; and, that experiment may be of
two kinds, experiments of simple fact and experiments of quantity.
It is unnecessary here to describe all the rigorous rules that the
man of science so rightly imposes upon himself before he claims to
have proved his hypothesis, merely adding that among others he
requires, Exclusion of Indifferent Circumstances, Simplifica­tion
of Experiments, Removal of Usual Conditions, Removal of Interference
of Unsuspected Conditions, Blind or Test Experiments,
Negative Results of Experiment, and he lays down the limits of
experiment. Those who have not for themselves investigated
some scientific problem may learn from this statement some of the
difficulties of the work of scientific men and will not fail to respect
and admire the caution, patience and honesty of the scientific worker,
and will perhaps feel the more gratitude to a class of men by whose
self-denying labours they live and move and have their being in a
modern state, and by whose discoveries, thus established, they are
frequently preserved from premature death.</p>


<h3>Experiments for the Present Purpose.</h3>

<p>Now in the matter of experiment for the proof of the thesis
that changes in the habits of an animal <i>cause</i> the changes observed
in their hair, it is at once seen that, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, no one can impose
and work with such calculated conditions as are ordained by
experiment, strictly so-called. The action of a habit is a slow
process and the movement of a hair is slow; moreover the lifetime
of a man is too short and that of a horse, for example, too long to
allow of any individual experimenter applying artificial pressure
through many generations of horses, so as to be able to verify his
assertion that the effects of artificial pressure do what is claimed,
and that these effects are transmitted from one genera­tion of horses
to another. One can conceive a calculated experiment of the kind
made with numerous individual rats, and successive generations,
but it is hardly likely that effectual pressure could be applied to
the hairy coats of such small and elusive mammals as would serve
to test the hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span></p>


<h3>Undesigned Experiments.</h3>

<p>We are thrown back, then, on such experiments as may be
provided for us by the uncalculated operations of man through
many ages. This class I call undesigned experiments and have
had more to say about numerous examples of these in another
place<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> Using the term experiment broadly we see many
occurrences which consist in an accidental observa­tion of a fact,
and Jevons mentions five of these which have led to organised
results in science—the double refrac­tion in Iceland spar by Erasmus
Bartholinus, the twitching of a frog’s leg under stimuli by Galvani,
the light reflected from distant windows with a double-refracting
substance by Malus, the form of a vertebra by Oken, and the
peculiar appearance of a solution of quinine by Sir John Herschel.
But he notes something further than this, that is, the way in which
astronomers make the earth’s orbit the basis of a well-arranged
<i>natural experiment</i>. He says further that “Nature has made no
experiment at all for us within historical times” among animals
living in a state of nature, allowing at the same time that man has
made an approach to experiment in his domestica­tion of many
animals. Huxley himself kept an open mind until the last as to the
validity of Natural Selection in the Origin of Species, because of
the fact that races which are sterile together have not yet been
produced by human cultiva­tion, for example, the sterility of mules,
the human product of the jackass and the mare. I allude to this
to show that such a result, if effected, would have constituted a
valuable experiment in biology in favour of Natural Selection.</p>


<h3>Harness on Horses.</h3>

<p>Man has, however, been carrying on unconsciously throughout
a great stretch of time an experiment upon the hair on the coat of a
horse by the use of harness. This is an old story and its rudiments
are mentioned by Professor Scott Elliott<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> He states that the
men of Cromagnon are believed by a high authority as to their
rock-paintings to have depicted some marks which represent rude
harness of some kind, though he himself expresses doubt on the
matter. He also quotes the same authority for the figures made
by the Madelenians as having found signs which can be interpreted
as halters or even bridles. Be this as it may, we need not carry
our search for the use of harness to this hoary antiquity, but
know well from history that for many thousands of years man has<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
been employing harness on his friend and servant, thus making the
essential conditions for an experiment of which he and his servant
were alike unconscious, that is to say, he influenced a growing
living structure, the horse’s hair, by the artificial force of pressure,
applied to the coat at various points. These varied from age to
age as to fashion and material, and the present full development
of harness of a draught horse was probably slow in coming.</p>


<h3>Examples of the Effects of Pressure.</h3>

<p>Looking at the figures of a horse harnessed, and another
without harness, Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_49">49</a> and <a href="#Fig_50">50</a>, one sees on the latter eight different
regions where patterns of hair, not found in the horse normally,
are displayed. They are as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>


<div class="center">

<p>All these aberrations from the normal are rare except the first
(<span class="lowercase smcap">A</span>), and all are based on the observa­tion and drawing of individual
specimens which I brought before the Zoological Society and
the details of which are given in a note on page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_129">129</a>. The
rarer seven examples are described because taken together they
show what the pressure of harness <i>can</i> do at certain points
where its pressure is adequate, and they are all situated where they
might be expected if such a force could effect hair-changes, and there
are <i>none of them found on areas where neither pressure nor underlying
muscular traction</i> can act efficiently. Thus in many thousands
of horses I have never seen a hair-pattern on the middle of the flank
or the under surface of the abdomen or the middle of the back or
gluteal region or on the fore or hind legs. This negative evidence
is of great importance, and must be taken for what it is worth.
I may venture to remind the reader that every one of these phenomena
is an artificial product of man’s treatment of the horse. They
come thus under the category of undesigned experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span></p>

<p>The only one of the eight artificial patterns, which as a rule
are in the form of a whorl feathering and crest, that needs, further
close attention is the pattern A, produced on the under surface
of the horse’s neck by the collar, and this will be examined
separately.</p>

<h3>The Selected Example—Ventral Surface of Horse’s Neck.</h3>

<p>If I set out to convince a doubting opponent that these things
are as I assert, three conditions may at once be laid down. First,
it must be shown that the patterns found here are not part of a<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
normal arrangement. Second, that they are produced by pressure
of the harness. Third, that examples of them be forthcoming in
young horses never exposed to the action of harness.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The normal arrangement of hair on the under surface
of the horse’s neck shows an even stream passing from the head to
the chest, where it is interrupted by the pectoral patterns, and during
that course resembles precisely the other normal streams in this
and other mammals.</p>

<p>The opponent asks, “How do you know this is the normal
slope, and that the patterns you describe are not normal, and what
you describe as normal is not a variation?” This is a perfectly<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
proper and timely question and can only be answered fully by
examina­tion of and noting a large number of draught horses.</p>


<h3>The Normal Arrangement on the Ventral Surface of the
Horse’s Neck.</h3>

<p>This examination has been made in a number of specimens
large enough to satisfy the most exacting opponent. In all, 748
were examined as to the hair on the under surface of the neck and
338 of these presented the normal arrangement and 411 showed
patterns of various kinds ranging from a trifling reversed area two
to three inches long on one side of the middle line, to a finely-formed
whorl, feathering and crest occupying the whole of the surface where<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
the collar is able to reach. These two limits are shown side by
side in the figures. I should add that among the 411 which I term
abnormal, for the sake of clear contrast, the number of varieties
of pattern were numerous and bewildering.</p>


<h3>Cart Horses.</h3>

<p>A very significant result followed from a special examina­tion
of 300 cart horses, as distinguished from hackneys. These showed
the astonishing number of 277 specimens of what I call the abnormal
and only 23 of the normal type. This special group in no way
weakens the force of the larger study of 748, for the 300 cart horses
are included in it, and, if removed, would have left the normal
specimens in the hackney or general group very much more numerous.
Looking at the cart horses, which are specimens of a highly-specialised
breed for heavy draught purposes, one may assert with some
confidence that, <i>for them</i>, the normal pattern of the hackney is
becoming their abnormal. It must be remembered that these great
creatures with large muscular necks are during most of their time
of work pulling hard against the collar, and the very conditions
required for making patterns of hair through pressure of harness
are present in a remarkable degree. It is indeed an <i>undesigned
experiment within an experiment</i>.</p>


<h3>Analogy.</h3>

<p>In addition to these statistics which may be taken as conclusive
on this question of the normal arrangement, I must point out that
it is against all reason, and analogy from <i>all other</i> mammals, to
doubt that the normal arrangement is as I describe it. No hair-clad
mammal either within the family of the Equidæ, or without, has
any other arrangement on the under surface of its neck than what
is here shown to be the normal one—a uniform uninterrupted slope
from the head to the chest. There is also a feature of this greatly
variegated piece of the horse’s coat under its neck, and that is
that it is so highly variegated with diversity of pattern as to make
it unlike any normal or natural structure or character in any animal.
<i>That</i> is not the way Nature does her normal work. It would be
impossible to give illustrations of many of the patterns here found,
though I have notes and sketches of a large number taken from the
examina­tion of thousands of specimens; so I have selected eight
(Figs.&nbsp;51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 and 58) of the best representatives
of these and the details of each are given under each figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span></p>


<h3>Effects of Pressure by Harness.</h3>

<p><i>Second.</i>—The next stage of the inquiry demands that one
should show the patterns to be due to pressure.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the accompanying drawings the under surface of the neck
and the chest of each horse is shown with the collar in place, the
centre portion of which is cut out so as to show the arrangement of
hair beneath, and some of the varieties are seen to extend for
several inches above it. In considering this process one ought to
watch the way in which the collar of a horse, as a rule, is seen to
move up and down as he trots, for in most cases, except in cart-horses,
the collar fits very loosely and is easily jolted upwards.<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
This will explain why the patterns often extend upwards above
the proper position of the collar, but it must also be remembered
that <i>never</i> have I found a pattern higher up in the middle of the
neck than a loose collar can reach when jolted. (Close to the
lower jaw there is a whorl or pattern often found which belongs
to a different category, and is not to be confused with the patterns
in question.)</p>

<p>In the conditions described there is present exactly that
frequent pressure of a moving body against the growing hair, which
is requisite to produce changes in its direction, as well as the more
fixed pressure of the collar when it is fitting firmly against the
lower part of the neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span></p>

Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_49">49</a> and <a href="#Fig_50">50</a>, in which the connec­tion between the pressure of

<p><span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span></p>

<p>I examined some mares of the farm-horse type with their foals
in a field at Radley in 1915 with the following results. All the
mothers showed the common reversed area or pattern on the under
surfaces of their necks. Of the five foals all but one showed clear
evidence, even in their thick young coats, of a similar pattern,
the fifth had none. I also noted two similar examples in a field
at Harrogate in the same year and both the mothers and the foals
showed the usual pattern; and again at Radley in 1918 four more<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
foals, one of them 24 hours old, who all showed this reversed area.
Here then are ten examples of undoubted transmission of the
effects of pressure by harness in subjects so young as to be still
suckled by their dams, and, of course, never themselves touched
by such pressure. I submit that even one such unmistakable
example would be enough to prove the case, and that the necessary
conditions of a rigorous undesigned experiment by man have been
fulfilled.</p>


<h3>Objections.</h3>

<p>At the end of this chapter which concludes the facts of the
case I think it may serve to make the position a little clearer if
I state objections which have been or might be raised.</p>

<p>It will not escape the mind of any person who has followed
critically this process of inquiry, that in Chapter VII, where the
immense variety of the patterns found on the side of the horse’s
neck are described, there is an apparent resemblance between them
and those on the ventral or under surface of the neck. The former
were shown to be due to natural forces, those of sustained and
repeated underlying muscular traction of muscles and jolting of the
neck in locomo­tion; whereas in this chapter a considerable number
of patterns have been brought forward and pictured on the under
surface, and these are attributed to artificial pressure from harness.
The reasonable objection is raised, “Why should the former be
considered natural and the latter artificial in their origin?”</p>

<p>The answer to this is supplied by a considera­tion of the muscles
shown in the two contrasted regions. In Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_3">3</a>, <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> and <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>, the
muscles of the side of the neck are shown to be remarkably <i>strong
and numerous</i> (in three layers), and <i>diverging in their directions</i>. In
the muscles of the under surface of the neck of the horse, see Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_12">12</a>,
the muscles of the two sides shown are nearly parallel and no
conflict of opposing or diverging muscles can well take place in this
“debateable land.” If there were much divergent or opposing
action going on it would, of course, produce the effects on the hair
towards the <i>upper</i> part of the neck, where the muscles tend to
diverge more and more as they pass to the head, and I have stated
above that not a single instance in many thousands of horses has
been found above the level where a loose collar ceases to rub when
jolted upwards. This is very conclusive on the matter of diverging
or opposing muscular action.</p>

<p>Then again the jolting in locomo­tion, which, in the case of
the side of the neck is probably more effectual in producing changes
of hair than even muscular traction, is almost absent from the under<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
surfaces, as can be learned from careful watching of the motion of a
horse.</p>

<p>Another reason which meets this objection very fully is that
I have shown that 300 cart horses presented 277 of their number
with reversed areas of patterns in the middle line of the under
surface of the neck and these thick-necked animals are just those
in which the collar is closely applied to the front of the neck in
their heavy draught work, thus rubbing almost incessantly against
the lie of the hair. In the thinner necks of the hackneys there
are comparatively few indeed of the patterns found here and their
collars as a rule fit very loosely and badly, and these frequently
show a jolting up and down <i>clear of the neck</i>, which is seldom if
ever present in a well-formed cart horse.</p>

<p>Further proof of this is shown by the simple fact that it is
<i>under the collar and within its range of movement</i> that the changes of
hair are produced.</p>

<p>No artificial pressure such as that of a collar is exerted on
the parts of the side of the neck where the patterns are found; so
I would submit that these two selected and much-disturbed areas
owe their hair-patterns to two wholly different forms of mechanical
cause.</p>

<p>I referred in the Preface to an important criticism of my
earlier book on <i>The Direction of Hair in Animals and Man</i>, and will
now treat this in some degree of detail. It is from the pen of an
eminent American biologist, then Miss Inez L. Whipple<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> now Mrs.
Wilder Harris, and it is a careful, independent and thoughtful
contribu­tion from one who by her studies in this field and in the
study of the mammalian palm and sole is widely known, and as
widely respected.</p>

<p>Miss Whipple refers on page&nbsp;403 to certain whorls and featherings
on the backs of the lion, ox, giraffe and larger antelopes,
which I then attributed to the action of the <i>panniculus carnosus</i>
in shaking off flies. I am free to confess that the action then
invoked by me was inadequate and incorrect and the explanations
now given of them in Chapters X. and XI. on the ox and the lion,
I think, are less open to criticism.</p>

<p>Again on page&nbsp;404 she mentions the view formerly expressed
as to the cause of the reversal of hair on the chest of man. This,
also, I have reconsidered fully in Chapter XIII. where the action of
the platysma muscle is held to be the cause of that remarkable
reversal.</p>

<p>On page&nbsp;403 the mistake I made in calling the reversed area<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
over the ischial tuberosity of the ischium in a dog a whorl is
pointed out. This is corrected in Chapter VI. on the Dogs.</p>

<p>These three are the only errors of any importance that I
acknowledge at once. A certain number of minor points are
questioned in the Review, and the theoretical portion is strongly
criticised. It would be irrelevant to the main purpose of a book
which is limited to the subject of Habit and Hair Direction in Animals
to introduce some of the more debateable branches of the subject
of the former book, such as tufts, the direction of the hair on the
mole, the classifica­tion of the hair-streams of the mammalian body
into primitive, those modified by morphological change, and those
due to use and habit. This last is a very wide subject and is far
beyond the present limits.</p>

<p>I freely make another acknowledgment. The whole of the
subject of the Direction of Hair in Animals and Man was taken up
<i>ad hoc</i>, that is to say, for the purpose of testing the unpopular
doctrine of Lamarckism. If this be an offence against the highest
spirit of science, I can but accept the charge with a sigh, and go on,
“faint yet pursuing.” There is consola­tion in finding that increased
study of a subject is bringing order out of chaos, even if the field
be small and the immediate crop poor.</p>

<p>The following are some of the objections raised to the theoretical
part of the <span class="nowrap">book:—</span></p>

<p>The most serious charge against my interpreta­tion of the mode
of formation of patterns (whorls and tufts) is that there is a lack
of harmony between my preliminary statement that whorls are
due to motor or muscular causes and a subsequent explana­tion of
some of them as due to external pressure. I did not state then as
clearly as I do now in many passages in the present chapters that
for pattern produc­tion there may be at least four causes: <i>friction</i>,
<i>pressure</i>, <i>gravity</i>, <i>underlying muscular traction</i>, and that whorls
and featherings may, of course, arise from some other external
force acting on the hair at the decisive point of struggle, just as
well as from the more common cause—muscular traction on the
skin. I think in this region of the Review and where she deals
with Selection, she shows signs of that scientific monism which is
still affecting many of our great biologists, that is to say, they desire
a world-empire in evolution for the great factor of Selection, and
will stretch their arguments considerably to save its face. This
is shown in the Review on page&nbsp;406 where a very thin plea is put
in on behalf of adapta­tion and Selection in regard to hair-directions,
as in man’s minute hairs, which cannot be seriously maintained.
That earth is stopped!</p>

<p>Darwin’s open-minded dualism in this matter of the factors of
evolution appeals to me at any rate more than the jealous attitude
of Weismann and his eminent adherents.</p>

<p>Miss Whipple is less determined than I am in claiming for
Selection the cause of the primitive slope of hair in mammals.
It is the only conceivable arrangement that could exist for the
advantage of the primitive forms in their simple life, and is, I submit,
as much a matter of adapta­tion to needs governed by Selection as
the possession of a dermal covering itself.</p>

<p>One more point, which, I think, is a small one and a fair one
to raise, is worthy of a few remarks. Miss Whipple states that
before variations in hair-direction can be logically attributed to
external forces (giving the instance of the human scalp) “it should
be shown that a change in the direction of the external, more or
less wiry portion of the hair produces a change in the direction
of the follicle.” As it happens, this change is easily seen in the
case of the reversed hairs of the human forearm, if the hair be
dark and the skin thin. The essence of the theory that dragging
on the skin by muscular traction causes the hair to change its
direction is that the relatively important portion within the hair-pit
is pulled here or there according to the incidence of the prevailing
force. But it is, to my mind, very clear that much repeated friction
or pressure or gravity acting on the external and longer portion
of the hair must, in course of time, drag the portion buried in the
skin with it and so change its direction. These two portions of a
hair cannot be arbitrarily separated. Shortly, one may say that
the push of a force is as evident as the pull. A similar change
in the direction of the buried part of a tree-trunk from a prevailing
wind can be traced.</p>

<p>The last point is that I “omit to explain the mechanical
process by which divergent muscular action could affect hair-direction.”
This is well answered in the chapter on “Can muscular
action in the individual change the direction of the hair?” for
there it is shown by numerous examples in the human eyebrow
that the muscles underneath the hairs which are embedded in the
true skin for a tangible depth, <i>do</i> play havoc with the normal
arrangement of hair, as the conflict proceeds, the resultant “pull”
being actually engraved, signed and sealed by physiological
wrinkles of the forehead and face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

FIRST SUMMARY.</h2>


<p>A large body of facts and an adequate propor­tion of reasoning
have been brought together in the preceding chapters. As far as
I understand the proceedings in a court of law, the business of
arriving at results or, as they are there called, verdicts, consists
in collecting as many as possible of the facts which bear on the case,
these are sifted and verified, or the reverse, a certain reasoning on
them is carried on; on this the verdict rests. This case before
the court is of a civil, not a criminal nature, and it is a claim made
to a certain <i>derelict property</i>, that is to say, the honour of forming
patterns on the hair of animals, claimed by Use and Habit. The
facts concerned have never been disputed, possibly because they
were not thought worth the trouble, but they have the singular
merit of being open to almost any educated person for confirma­tion
or correc­tion, and the reasoning is certainly not profound, though
I think it is cogent. In seeking a result in such a cause, or verdict,
one claimant might content himself with an arrest of judgment,
another that judgment should go by default, and a third would
claim proof. It is with the last I desire to stand.</p>

<p><i>In one word the claim is that of causation.</i></p>

<p>Now no one can deny that between the groups of phenomena,
habits and hair-patterns there is an evident relation; but the question
may still arise, “What is the link between them?” I have just
said that the facts are unquestioned; substantially they are unquestionable,
and they are open to the charge that they belong
to the dust-heaps of science, that they are, biologically speaking,
such as used to engage the attention of Nicodemus Boffin. Perhaps
they are. Of course if they were just collected haphazard and
treated like a big collec­tion of little shells in a cabinet, without
reference to their natural order, they would possess no evidential
value even if they were pretty, for so long as a natural fact remains
without its suited interpreta­tion, so long it belongs not to science.
Hear Jevons: “Whatever is, is, and no natural fact is unworthy
of study for the purpose of its interpreta­tion.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> Hear also Sir E.<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
Ray Lankester: “That only is entitled to the name of science which
can be described as knowledge of causes or knowledge of the order
of Nature.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> Fortified by the authority of a great logician and a
great biologist I proceed to claim proof of causation. The stages
of the case may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p class="ml2em">1. It has been shown that during the lifetime of an individual,
muscular action can change the direction of the hair.
Chapter VIII.</p>

<p class="ml2em">2. Undesigned experiment has shown that changes in the
direction of the hair, mechanically produced in the
individual, are sometimes transmitted to the descendants.
Chapter XV.</p>

<p class="ml2em">3. In all the selected examples adequate and ascertainable
causes have been demonstrated.</p>

<p class="ml2em">4. The changes of hair described, with hardly an exception,
cannot be conceived as resulting from the factors of
organic evolution—heredity, variation, adapta­tion and
selection—indeed no serious attempt has been made to
connect them in any way with utility.</p>


<h3>Causation.</h3>

<p>For my sins, the most obvious of which is that I made an
unfortunate choice of my first birthday, I had to learn up the
dreary pages of Mill’s <i>Logic</i> and those of other philosophers, for
the pleasure of taking a medical degree, and was reduced to that
orthodox state of mind in which one was forbidden to suppose that,
in the world around where common men and women, every day and
all day, are tracing causes for the occurrences they see on every
hand, there was anything at work which could be truly called a
cause. It was but natural to fall into the nihilism of the Mill and
Karl Pearson school. Having neither the knowledge nor the
hardihood to discern that their bewildering notions of causation
could be gainsaid, I had to remain submissive and as much contented
as possible with their views of an elusive subject. This state of
passive resistance was not relieved until I had the great advantage
of reading a valuable book by the late Dr. Mercier on Causation,
which seems to have let some fresh air into the musty doctrines
of the orthodox and autocratic philosophers. No one who has read
this work can doubt that after all there is such a process as causation,<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
and that to find a cause for events is not merely a pursuit of the
vulgar, but a duty of scientific persons.</p>

<p>Mill appears to have given eighteen different accounts of
causation and to have contradicted himself over and over again in
his works dealing with this puzzle, devised mainly by Hume and
himself; and his successors, such as Dr. Mc’Taggart, the Hon.
Bertrand Russell of “Dog Fight” fame, Mr. Welton and Prof. Karl
Pearson, have only got as far as to reduce the number of his definitions
and put his views into more modern, but equally misleading
terms. Without any disparagement of their other claims to respect
and admira­tion, one may venture to throw overboard this school
of philosophers when considering causation, and one may walk
and talk in a clearer atmosphere.</p>

<p>The subjects here considered are cause, effect, result, reason,
evidence and proof, and all can be seen to enter into my small
thesis. They may then be defined, according to Dr. Mercier, as
<span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="ml2em">1. A cause is an action, or cessation of action, connected
with a sequent change or accompanying unchange, in the
thing acted on, or more shortly for my purpose <i>a cause
is an action upon a thing</i>.</p>

<p class="ml2em">2. An effect is a change connected with a preceding action.</p>

<p class="ml2em">3. In reference to causation a reason means the cause of an
unchange.</p>

<p class="ml2em">4. A result is the changed state that is left when an effect
has been produced.</p>

<p class="ml2em">5. Evidence is of three kinds: evidence of sense, evidence
of reason and evidence of hearsay.</p>

<p class="ml2em">6. Proof is evidence inconsistent with an alternative to the
assertion.</p>

<p>I turn now to the aid given to the case before the jury, and
must show how Dr. Mercier’s definitions establish it.</p>

<p>The cause of the changes described is the action of certain
new habits on a living growing structure of the mammalian body.</p>

<p>The effect is the change connected with the preceding change
of habit.</p>

<p>The result is the changed direction of hair, in other words,
new patterns, left when the new habits have been produced, and
have been long enough in operation.</p>

<p>The reason for the unchanges observed in many instances is
the primitive force of the normal direction of growth of the hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span></p>

<p>The proof of the thesis is that the changes described in the hair—the
evidence—is inconsistent with an alternative assertion.</p>


<h3>To Some Critics.</h3>

<p>It may save time and trouble if replies are given in anticipa­tion
to certain classes of critics. I refer of course to those who are
well-informed in their branch of knowledge.</p>

<p>To those of high authority and learning, those who ride on
white asses and that sit in judgment, who may seek to throw the
case into chancery, saying, “This will never do, it contradicts
current biological opinion.” I can only meekly reply that current
or orthodox opinion is frequently wrong, or (shall I say) seldom
right, and that the history of human thought is strewn with
examples which may justify my impertinent reply.</p>

<p>To another who says, “I daresay you are right in your claim,
but there are too many metaphors,” I would suggest that, so long
as metaphors are not used as arguments, the more metaphors—within
limits—the clearer the meaning of the statement.</p>

<p>To him who grudgingly allows, “I think you have proved your
case—but what does it prove?” I reply that it proves what it
set out to prove, no more and no less, and it is an integral part of
proof of a larger claim. And if he further grumble that these
matters have no interest for him, one may ask him to live and let
live. “What have I now done in comparison of you, is not the
gleaning of your grapes of great Ephraim better than the vintage
of this little Abiezer?”</p>

<p>To the man who reads the preface and the headings of the
chapters, glances at the illustrations, detects one split infinitive,
two misspellings and three errors of punctua­tion, goes home to tea
and writes his opinion—it may suffice to remind him of “that
curious mental state which looks past problems without seeing
them.”</p>

<p>I will conclude this section with a parable.</p>

<p>In the year 1788 Arthur Young in his travels through France
visited the desolate region of the Landes. “Wastes, wastes,
wastes!” was his lament over neglected Brittany, and no less could
he say of the Landes, at that time a miserable tract of low ground,
bordering the Bay of Biscay. Plantations, the sinking of wells,
drainage and irriga­tion began to fix the unstable sands, making
fruitful the marsh, creating a healthful climate and a fertile soil.
Early in the 19th century the land here was sold <i>au son de la
voix</i>, that is to say, the accepted standard of measurement was
<i>the compass of the human lungs</i>. The stretch of ground reached<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
by a man’s voice sold for a few francs. Crops replaced the scanty
herbage of the salt marsh, and a familiar characteristic of the
landscape, the shepherd on stilts, was seen no more. Six hundred
thousand hectares of Landes planted with sea pines produced resin
to the annual value of fifteen million francs, and through these
trees also was achieved a climatic revolu­tion, and it is this district
which is now a department of a great and well-ordered State<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

VARIETIES OF EPIDERMIS.</h2>


<p>Passing now to the smaller trenches of the front line I have chosen
as the first of them a small study of the varieties of epidermis
found in mammals. With the exception of aquatic mammals
so few of this, the greatest vertebrate class, are not clothed with
hair that it is only on the comparatively hairless body of man,
with its third of a million fine hairs, that the varieties of epidermis
can be broadly studied. Much of this chapter will resolve itself
into a considera­tion of the palmar and plantar surfaces of certain
mammals, where no hairy covering obscures the operation of
stimulus and response.</p>

<p>I assume that the foregoing phenomena of hair-direction have
chosen and raised on his shield their own king. But here I must
ask of the succeeding groups when they say, “I am, Sir, under the
King, in some authority,” the question, “Under which King,
Bezonian, speak or <span class="nowrap">die”—</span></p>

<p class="ml2em">Shall it be Darwin’s Personal Selection?<br />
Roux’s Cellular or Histonal Selection?<br />
Wallace’s and Romanes’ Sexual Selection?<br />
Weismann’s Germinal Selection?<br />
The rule of Mendel?<br />
Selection of mutations according to de Vries?<br />
Or shall it be the barbarian king <i>Plasto-diēthēsis</i>?</p>

<p>Which indeed of the seven kings will they choose, if I may
thus personify them? I may, perhaps, urge on them the mild
and tolerant rule of Lamarck and Darwin rather than that of the
other anointed sovereigns, hoping this cannot be taken as an
attempt to influence the jury through the Press in a case which
is still <i>sub judice</i>.</p>


<h3>Stimuli and Response.</h3>

<p>The skin over the trunk and limbs of man is exposed to stimuli
of pressure, friction, heat, cold and wind in very different degrees,
according to the part which it covers. I do not here refer to nocuous,
or so-called noci-cipient stimuli, as being too casual in their incidence
for the question in hand. Broadly the ventral surface of the neck<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
and trunk differ much, in respect of the qualities of their epidermis,
from the dorsal. The skin over the former is softer, thinner and
more flexible than the latter, which is in adult life thick, hard and
with larger openings of the sebaceous glands. As the two main
layers of the skin are so closely united it is impossible to state any
general rule as to the parts played in this manufacture by the
epidermis and dermis respectively. Altogether the skin from
the dorsal surfaces of mammals provides a much denser fabric than
the latter, and different qualities of leather are obtained from different
regions. Corresponding differences of texture are found on the
extensor and flexor surfaces of the limbs, especially on the hands
and feet. In the course of his long evolution from a hairy stock,
whether simian as we thought yesterday, or a lower one as Professor
Woods Jones suggests to-day, these dorsal surfaces of neck, trunk
and extensor surfaces of limbs have been exposed through countless
generations of men to vastly more stimuli of friction, pressure,
and response, than those of the ventral and flexor regions. As
man’s hairy covering diminished, through some mysterious and
at present unrecognised cause, these stimuli became increasingly
potent in producing a tissue denser than that of the more protected
ventral parts where all forms of these stimuli are slight. I do not
claim that this was a phenomenon that began with man, for in a
measure it was present in those forms which preceded him, and
in many related mammals under the cover of their hairy covering.</p>

<p>When we remember, or conceive what a large portion of
each of his 24-hours even in his earliest form throughout life man
must have spent, as he still does, in lying on his back or sides,
and in sitting with his back against a supporting object, and with
his gluteal and ischial regions pressed hard against whatever
seat he has selected in cave or drawing-room, we need not travel
far in thought to understand how great has been the preponderance
of stimuli from friction and pressure on the dorsal and extensor
surfaces over those on the ventral and flexor—and here comes in our
familiar “total experience” with stimulus and response spread
over a vast stretch of time. It must be borne in mind that from
the facts of the case a very large number of individual men and
women were exposed to similar, but not the same stimuli at each
stage of the process involved. It is matter of common knowledge
that not only on the palm and sole of man, but on regions where
the skin is not specialised in that remarkable manner that is found
in those regions, but also in others, that increased pressure and
friction will very soon cause a harder and thicker growth of epidermis,
as on the skin over a projecting bone in club-foot, over the<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
shoulder where a weight is constantly carried, on the knuckles of
many manual workers, and over the patellæ of a devout Roman
Catholic, as I have often seen.</p>

<p>On the other hand what conditions more calculated to thin
and soften the skin could exist than those operating on the ventral
and flexor surfaces, axillæ, groins, external genitals and the bends
of the elbow and knee-joints, where pressure, with little friction
and greater warmth and moisture prevails? I need do no more
than ask which is the more reasonable of the two forthcoming
explanations of such phenomena, on the one hand that they are
adapted <i>for</i>, and on the other adapted <i>by</i> this experience? I
doubt if at any stage of the long process this slow manufacture of
differing fabrics ever conferred on man any survival value or better
matrimonial prospects. At any period or stage which I have
supposed it can only be claimed for the results on the skin that they
did <i>not</i> cause the animal to pass through the meshes of the sieve,
and theoretically might be classed among the <i>indifferent</i> modifications,
even if they added a little to the comfort of their possessor.</p>


<h3>Skin of Palm and Sole.</h3>

<p>One can examine in more detail the remarkable form of skin
which is found to cover the palmar and plantar surfaces in many
mammals. It is highly specialised and appears in many degrees
of efficiency for the purposes, or uses, of walking and climbing,
grasping and discrimina­tion of objects. With two or three insignificant
exceptions these are the only regions even of man’s body
where hairs do not grow in the normal state, and in most other
mammals hair is absent from the component parts or pads, which
correspond to our palms and soles. In the absence of hairs and
sebaceous glands and the presence of as many as 320 sweat-glands
to the square centimetre, and especially the papillary ridges, the
mammalian hand and foot present a fruitful field for study. They
have been studied by none more earnestly and thoroughly than
Dr. H. Wilder Harris and Mrs. Wilder Harris (<i>née</i> Inez Whipple).
This small area of skin as an organ for grasping and discrimina­tion
has been studied by persons from different, but not conflicting
points of view. Time would fail me even to mention these, but I
would recall here one aspect of the matter, that is the name given
to it by these eminent authorities, Friction Skin. I think I do
them no injustice, nay even honour, when I claim them as allies
for us “Old Contemptibles” in the struggle, Lamarck <i>v.</i> Darwin in
respect of these characters of the “mammalian chiridium.” This
is a term employed by them for the hand and foot of all mammals,<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
and is very convenient for descriptive purposes. From this point
of view this organ has been produced from more generalised ancestral
structures by reason of friction and pressure, and not for the
purpose of resisting them, at least in their initial stages—again,
adapted <i>by</i> and not adapted <i>for</i> meeting those forces. There are
other views of the matter held by Pan-Selectionists, notably that
of Dr. Hepburn, in regard to the papillary ridges. He would, as I
gather, treat them as primarily induced, by selection, for the better
grasping of objects cylindrical or more or less globular. I have
referred <span class="nowrap">elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> at some length to this in a book describing the
examina­tion of the hands and feet of eighty-six species of mammals.
The varieties of epidermis were divided into the smooth, corrugated,
scaly, nodular, hairy, rod-like and ridge-covered forms, also four
mixed varieties, such as corrugated with coarse transverse ridges on
the digits, corrugated with papillary ridges, nodular with papillary
ridges, and hairy with coarse transverse ridges and smooth pads.
Of these the species with smooth epidermis and hair are few and
unimportant, and the largest group examined was that of the
Primates, thirty in all, in which papillary ridges were always present.
It is highly probable that the causes of these modifications of the
epidermis in diverse groups of animals could be traced to the habits
and modes of life of each, but I make no attempt here to do this.
It is also matter for inquiry, upon which no agreement has apparently
been reached, how it came to pass that man has virtually lost his
hairy coat, and in regard to the palms and soles of animals, what
may be the reason that so few have any hair on them, and why
man has no sebaceous glands, but has very numerous sweat-glands
in these regions.</p>

<p>This is all of great interest, and possibly some day the
Mendelians will solve for us the mysteries thereof. But here I
need only ask how it would have been possible for hairs to grow,
or, if growing, not to be promptly worn away on a surface used by
animals from monotreme to man for walking-pads, and by most
of them also for grasping and discrimina­tion between objects as
well. We are so familiar with the thickening of the skin on the
hands of manual workers and on the feet of those who walk much,
to say nothing of what we call a “corn,” from pressure of tight
boots, that we are in danger of forgetting that the protecting skin
over the hands and feet of animals was of necessity adjusted in a
crude way to the measure and kind of walking in past ages and in
all levels of life, and that it is maintained in that adjusted condition
by the use, or disuse, of each life. Another familiar example is<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
that of knee-pads, as in the gnu and other ungulates. Some such
process it is legitimate to assume whether it be reckoned backwards
to monotremes or later levels of life-forms. We see then before
our eyes how this living tissue becomes adapted in varied ways by
response to the stimuli of friction and pressure, and the modifications
thus slowly effected must, one would suppose, be transmitted to
offspring ultimately from the original groups with which the process
began, when by frequent repeti­tion small changes of structure
have arisen at last. I acknowledge the limited force of the answer,
that this picture involves the continuance in each succeeding
genera­tion of the stimuli which initiated the changes, but the fact
remains that <i>ex hypothesi</i> the changes are there, written in tablets
of animal tissue, and that the making-up of an organism in course
of many ages is not and cannot be conceived as being governed
alone by the “tyranny,” even in the <i>good</i> Greek sense of that word,
of rigid unit-characters.</p>

<p>In the assumed process the correcting force of the Lamarckian
drill-sergeant is always at hand, as it superintends the construc­tion
of tissues and parts, and I doubt if even Professor Thomson will
here interpose the difficulty of “correla­tion with useful characters,”
for the only important functions which are invoked as the invariable
antecedent of these structures are the elementary habits of walking,
climbing or grasping objects in certain different ways, and without
these habits or functions there would be neither lemur, monkey nor
man to interest the mind of a biologist from Mars. As I am desirous
of condensing such replies as I can make to certain opinions of
opponents and objections, I will remind the reader that Professor
Bateson in the <i>Jubilee Volume</i> of 1909, pp.&nbsp;100, 101, uses a metaphor
to illustrate his view that among the facts of nature we meet certain
definite structures and patterns in which we ought not, if desiring
rightly to interpret them, to expect to find <i>purposefulness</i>. He
says: “Such things are, as often as not, I suspect rather of the
nature of tool-marks, mere incidents of manufacture, benefiting
their possessor not more than the wire-marks in a sheet of paper,
or the ribbing on the bottom of an oriental plate renders these
objects more attractive in our eyes.” Metaphors are both indispensable
and delightful, they are the very salt of scientific and other
sober writings, but they have a rather “slim” way of betraying
their employers. They express at times the truth too well, and at
others when vague and inaccurate lead the reader right astray.
Thinking of this metaphor of tool marks I was in a modern church
the other day and saw just before me a stone pillar the pediment
of which was marked with oblique parallel marks of a mason’s tool.<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
Here then there were marks left by a human hand at some date
or other and by means of some tool or other. I know one may not
reason by an analogy from inorganic to organic phenomena in which
the push and force of life is in full blast, and that inheritance in the
former is ruled out; but, taking the metaphor seriously, you have
to account for the appearance of the ribbing of paper and the
mason’s marks on the stone. To call them “by-products” or
“tool marks” or <i>obiter facta</i>, or by any suggestive name, does
not advance the reply to the question, “Whence came this great
multitude?” If I were unwary enough to be here trying to attack
Selection and to respond to the invita­tion of the more learned
arachnida to walk into his parlour with a scheme of organic evolution
for him to demolish at his leisure, I should have to enter upon the
question of adapta­tion, specific difference and perhaps other great
disputed doctrines. But, knowing my own limits, and desiring
to keep to the self-imposed limits of the title of this book, I again
plead that I am here contending, as all through it, for the origin
of initial modifications by use and habit, and for nothing else.
No one who reads of the immense amount of research and learning
that are being carried on by the students of Mendelism and Mutationism
can fail to admire them. But, as I have remarked before,
these are systems of thought which in the main deal with characters
by distribu­tion or “unpacking,” as it is called. Such a process
of course leads to new characters by amphimixis, and no one of
whom I know denies it. Such work is concerned with fresh views
of the origin of species, but with lamentable cowardice, or humility,
I leave all that great sphere to those who are incomparably more
fit for it, and just seek to mind my own business.</p>

<p>In subsequent chapters on modifications and their origin I
shall not need to repeat these observations.</p>


<h3>Some Chosen Examples of Palms and Soles.</h3>

<p>The facts then of a few selected examples of the palms and soles
of mammals are shortly these.</p>

<p>A heavy, burrowing animal, the <i>earth wolf</i> of the Cape, has a
very smooth, hard epidermis covering its foot-pads and is thus a
generalised structure which I have found in no other animal.</p>

<p>The common <i>mole</i> which uses its broad strong fore-feet like
a pair of spades, and depends chiefly for discrimina­tion of its habitat
on the delicate sensory nerve-endings of its snout, has a hard nodular
skin which is much less developed on the hind feet than the fore
feet, the latter being less active tools. It has no papillary ridges,
in accordance with this fact, and is a very efficient miner that never<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
practises ca’ canny, as we know to our cost when we go out in the
morning and find great heaps of soft earth thrown up in the line
of its advance from its base or fortress. Such a mode of life lends
itself remarkably to the kind of skin on its feet, and this is <i>now</i> at
any rate adapted <i>to</i> its environment.</p>

<p>The <i>capybara</i> is a large, heavily-built rodent, and has rather
a smooth epidermis not specially thick, with long and efficient
papillæ of the corium shown in microscopical sections. Being
largely aquatic in its habitat, and given to frequenting marshy
ground and to enjoying as much sleep as it can manage, it depends
a good deal for discrimina­tion of objects on its sensitive corium,
and its epidermis is not much specialised for, or by friction and
pressure in walking. It does not acquire by reason of stimuli and
response any unnecessary tools.</p>

<p>With this may be classed the <i>echidna</i> or Australian ant-eater
which has sparse hairs set on a hard and slightly corrugated epidermis,
and, being mainly a nocturnal animal and living a secluded
life, it does not walk much or far in its stealthy pursuit of worms
and insects, and the stimuli of friction or pressure encountered
by it are few.</p>

<p>A similar condition is found on the feet of many small carnivores.</p>

<p>Animals with scales on their feet, which are held to constitute
the earliest stage of the Primate modifica­tion of papillary ridges
are such as the <i>potoroo</i>, <i>wallaby</i>, <i>kangaroo</i> and <i>giant ant-eater</i>. Such
scales register a long, long series of stimuli of friction and pressure
in these and their ancestors, in a level of life before any delicate
discrimina­tion of surfaces came into operation.</p>

<p>The nodular form of skin is present in the Canadian <i>tree porcupine</i>,
where rough nodules cluster closely on the surface of both
feet, and it is a significant fact that it shares with the American
<i>opossum</i> the peculiarity of nodules on the ventral surface of the
powerful prehensile tail. This adapta­tion tends to efficiency in its
arboreal life, and may well have been produced by infinitely small
degrees of response in structure in the course of a long evolution.</p>

<p>The <i>rabbit</i> alone have I found with rod-like projections of the
epidermic cells, among which are set in dense order the soft, long,
delicate hairs and which thus conduce to its wonderful power of
treading on sharp objects without injury. We thus see the inner
meaning of dear old Brer Rabbit’s jeer of triumph to Brer Fox,
“Born and bred in a brier bush.” This adapta­tion might be an
unit-character segregated from the ancestral stock of the Leporidæ,
or it might not, but at any rate the rabbit leads a life in which its<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
walking or running is no more prominent or frequent than is a good
“run” on the part of a hunter which pursues the hare with his
beagles, and one may say at least this—that its mode of life has
<i>not</i> produced a hard rough nodular surface on its feet by stimuli
of pressure and friction and response.</p>

<p>One may observe that there’s a divinity doth shape our ends,
rough hew them as we may, even if some objection be taken to the
present view of rough-hewing of parts of our organism on the
ground of its piecemeal character, rather than dealing with the
organism as a whole. To which it may be replied that the Mendelians
give high support to the piecemeal study of the profound
subject of genetics, and further that the business here is to look
separately and simply at a few selected attributes of parts of
an organism, and see how they <i>began</i> to grow big enough to avoid
passing through the meshes of the sieve.</p>

<p>The foregoing examples of animals in which papillary ridges
are absent have been given not in their zoological order, nor as
representative of a great many groups, but as taken from the
eighty-six species I examined myself. The following belong to the
same series, but all present papillary ridges in an ascending scale
towards perfec­tion in man.</p>


<h3>Examples of Ridge-covered Palms and Soles.</h3>

<p>The common <i>hedgehog</i> though a burrowing animal like the
<i>mole</i> is not always underground as his distant relative is. He is
not always mining and though of ancient lineage he is a “slacker”
compared with the mole, hibernating for months, and spending
also much time in his nest and prowling slowly about above ground
for insects. He has thus acquired his somewhat indifferent epidermis
that one finds, but with the addition of sparse papillary ridges.
It is the species among this list with the fewest of these tactile
structures, for there are but three or four separate ridges on six
of the ten digits, and radiating groups on only three of all the palmar
and plantar pads. So <i>quâ</i> touch it is ill-equipped, though it has
adapted a higher form of tool than the rabbit.</p>

<p>The common <i>squirrel</i>, that sits much and walks mainly on
branches of trees just as much as it needs to do, has an epidermis
little differentiated, and one which is corrugated with scanty
papillary ridges on the palmar and plantar pads, and none on the
digits.</p>

<p>The <i>squirrel-like phalanger</i> which flies always more or less
downwards by a kind of parachute-arrangement has most of its
palmar and plantar skin covered with papillary ridges encroaching<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
upon its corrugated areas, and a response to more delicate tactile
experience has been thus produced by its intermittent performance
of ordinary progression.</p>

<p><i>Azara’s opossum</i> presents about as large a part of the surface
covered with nodules as with papillary ridges, the latter highly-developed
for an animal so low, zoologically-speaking, but one in
which delicate discrimina­tion is much practised.</p>

<p>The <i>kinkajou</i>, another arboreal animal which walks about on
trees more than it uses its feet for prehension, trusting much to
its prehensile tail, shows its corrugated epidermis and papillary
ridges developed in about equal proportions.</p>

<p>These five mammals thus show that the stimuli of pressure
and friction and the response to them are being complicated by
the addition of the more delicate tactile organs known as papillary
ridges, and these, perhaps, in a secondary way are becoming useful
in preventing friction. But I must not omit to point out that,
<i>quâ</i> preven­tion of slipping, the few sparse papillary ridges of the
<i>hedgehog</i>, <i>squirrel</i>, <i>kinkajou</i> and <i>flying-phalanger</i>, especially those
on the extreme tips of the digits, could have no effect in this
preven­tion and no survival value. It is otherwise when they are
developed in large areas as in the succeeding groups.</p>


<h3>Primates.</h3>

<p>All the thirty species of Primates possessed papillary ridges
to such an extent that only small areas of the palmar and plantar
skin of the lemurs showed any other than these remarkable
characters. It is so much a property of the Primate hand and foot
to possess these that it might be almost made a matter of ordinal
rank belonging to the Primates, were it not that a few stray lower
mammals also possess it.</p>

<p>The <i>black-headed lemur</i> is the lowest Primate examined and
it is characterised by highly developed patterns of ridges on the
palm and sole, and these are interspersed with nodules on the
regions less exposed to pressure. The complexity of the patterns
of another, the <i>ring-tailed lemur</i>, is greater still. Now these nodules
are distinguished from the rough undifferentiated nodules of lower
forms, such as the Canadian <i>tree-porcupine</i>, and from the scales
in others. When examined with a lens the separate nodules show
small groups of papillary ridges two, three or four on each nodule,
arranged in a direction parallel to those of neighbouring nodules.
They are in fact papillary ridges in embryo, and shortly above this
lemur-stage in the ascent of animal life they are merged into papillary
ridges in patterns. All this is well told at length by Dr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
H. Wilder Harris. I refer to it here because the disappearance
of the rough, plain, nodular or corrugated epidermis in mammals
is coincident with increasing activity and intelligence in forms who
employ or acquire a more delicate sense of touch in their hands
and feet. The cruder response of structure to stimuli of friction
and pressure, evident in the lower forms, is abandoned in the higher,
as tactile delicacy in prehension comes more into play. Here,
for example, may be a subtle case of the co-operation of the mould
and sieve in action.</p>

<p>From this lemur-level the degree of development in the Primate
palm and sole rises and falls, but always advances through the
<i>lemuroidea</i>, <i>monkeys</i> and <i>anthropoid apes</i> to man. No attempt
at the tracing of the lineage is made here, and from the present
limited point of view little remains to be said about different
Primates. Only two of those examined will be briefly referred to,
the <i>slow loris</i> and man.</p>

<p>The <i>slow loris</i> shares with many monkeys and apes a very soft
moist skin of the palm and sole, and in this and other refinements
of this region it is much beyond many more intelligent, active
and higher Primates. I have never had social intercourse with a
<i>loris</i>, but I have shaken the friendly little hand of a <i>chimpanzee</i>
with a combina­tion of pleasure, mild shock and perhaps memories
of my own palms in the more nervous moments of early life. It is
a strange, cool, soft and damp surface, but the sensation conveyed
by the skin of a <i>loris</i> lately dead show that in life it is a wonderfully
sensitive and tender structure. The whole of the palm and sole
is covered with well-developed patterns of papillary ridges especially
on the palmar and plantar pads. No trace of old-fashioned nodules,
scales or corruga­tion is to be found. The structures due to stimuli
of friction and pressure in its ancestors have disappeared for ever
from this specialised and small group, and we may fairly hold, in
accordance with the law of conserva­tion of energy, that the past is
somehow enwrapped in the present in the strange hands and feet
of the <i>loris</i>. The adaptations of the hand and foot of the <i>loris</i>
are most obviously now of value to it in its wary and dangerous
life in the branches of trees, but are equally unfitted for that higher
life which, in his case, consists in going lower down, on the ground.
The extraordinary deliberate life of the <i>loris</i> has been often described.
As he moves from place to place on a branch, fixing one limb before
he moves another, much as we do in going up a ladder, he is subjected
much to the stimuli of pressure, but hardly at all to those of friction.
He sets us a good example of leaving nothing to chance. Thus
his soft sensitive skin suits well his mode of progression, but he<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
would find the harder, rougher skin of an African baboon very
inferior for the purpose. Here, indeed, I have ventured on the
edge of Tom Tiddler’s ground, and the Pan-Selectionist or Mendelian
will make a grab at me so that I escape with just the loss of a portion
of clothing. After escaping I have only to observe to him as to the
adaptations of a <i>loris’s</i> hand and foot that in human life, of which
we know a little, one can in a measure forecast what a man will be
like if we are told on reliable authority what he and his ancestors
have <i>not</i> done in the way of muscular or cerebral output, without
informa­tion as to what he has done. This is too obvious, but also
too complex to prove here by numerous illustrations and it may
be left as a mere sugges­tion as to the past life of the <i>loris</i> and his
ancestors for many generations. He has <i>not</i> walked in the ordinary
method of terrestrial mammals, he has always moved very slowly
about the branches of trees, he sleeps most of the day in a hollow
of a tree, curled up like a ball, and his home is in moist, tropical
regions. No habits and conditions of life could be better calculated
to soften and moisten the skin over his palms and soles or expose
it less to stimuli of friction, while even those of pressure in his
tenacious grasp of boughs are decidedly intermittent. Unless
one may assume the appearance in the distant past of some unit-character
of soft, moist skin in this and other Primates, it seems
difficult to refuse the Lamarckian claim of long, long absence of
effectual stimuli of friction and equally long presence of enervating
“negative” conditions. Proof of such a view is, of course, wanting.</p>


<h3>Palm and Sole of Man.</h3>

<p>The palm of man’s hand is a miracle of adaptations for touch
and grasping, but has lost most of the coarse structure formed in
response to stimuli of pressure and friction which we saw were
common in lower mammals. This indeed he shares with most
simian forms. The skin of our hands is now very much what we
make it and responds very soon to fresh positive or passive conditions.
The horny, cracked epidermis on palm and digit of the
old sailor may be contrasted with the soft and flexible and pale
surface of his twin-brother, the bank clerk, who is of studious habits
and has neither the vice of gardening nor golf. If one compares
the hand of the ordinary maid with that of her mistress the difference
is striking. But if one compares the hand of that mistress with that
of her spinster sister who has lain for twenty years in bed or on a
couch, the difference is equally significant. Indeed the sofa-and-bed-ridden
invalid, of whom I knew a few once, but who have gone
out of fashion, gives the observer some useful thoughts as to the<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
why and wherefore of the strange skin of the hands of the <i>slow
loris</i> previously referred to. And if he be disposed also to the
pleasant pursuit of moralizing at the expense of others he will feel
led to reflect over harshly on the invalid and compare her outlook
on life with that of the <i>loris</i>. Even in this concrete case of the
hand of an invalid there may be evidence of positive as well as
negative response, if one examines the right forefinger so much
used in sewing, where the skin becomes hard and thick.</p>

<p>The foot of man has a good deal of negative evidence in favour
of my conten­tion as well as positive. As to the latter, in the
thickening of the skin over the heel and ball of the great toe in those
who walk much we find changes precisely similar to those on the
hand. The negative or degenerative changes visible on man’s
foot consist chiefly in the remarkable simplicity of pattern of the
papillary ridges as well as their flattening and blurring, through
wasting of those which occupy mainly the arch of the foot. These
will be shown in the next chapter in a drawing. When this portion
of skin is compared with that of the foot of any monkey or anthropoid
ape it is clear that in this respect the skin of man’s foot has
undergone even more degenera­tion than his hand has shown of
higher development. This degenera­tion has coincided with two
facts, first that man’s terrestrial locomo­tion has advanced far beyond
that of any other Primate, and second, that he alone has a plantar
arch. This subject belongs to a later chapter and is referred to
here because the possession of an arch to his foot has caused man
to escape, on the under surface of it, a vast propor­tion of the stimuli
of pressure and friction involved in his mode of walking, and the
extreme simplicity of his plantar papillary ridges, and relatively
thin, soft skin under the plantar arches affords a fairly conclusive
example of change of structure from disuse <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>I have thus only selected and used two striking types of the
Primates, the <i>loris</i> and man, not wishing to burden this part of the
subject unduly with intervening and less characteristic forms of
life. It may be legitimate here to say in defence of this long chapter
that it illustrates what I desire to keep before me all through, the
fact that use, habit, environment and selection go ever hand in
hand. In all matters of science one has to descend to particulars,
so it seemed necessary to select a few scattered phenomena in the
best known groups of higher animals and endeavour to understand
how certain “characters” or better “modifications” <i>began</i> to
grow big enough to avoid passing through the meshes of the sieve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

ARRANGEMENT OF THE PAPILLARY RIDGES.</h2>


<p>The subjects of the preceding, present, and the succeeding
chapter are closely allied, from the fact that they all deal with
structural changes in the mammalian skin, and that most of these
are exhibited for us on our own palms and soles. They certainly
comply with the canons of Henri Poincaré as to simplicity, regularity
and chance of recurring.</p>

<p>In the last chapter, papillary ridges as organs of touch were
briefly referred to, but their mode of development into complicated
patterns do not concern the questions here at issue. The general
manner in which they are arranged on the hands and feet of man
and the Primates below him is very much a matter for such Lamarckian
methods of inquiry as I have chosen. In this examina­tion
of the ridges I will proceed from man backwards among the Primates
and lower still. I described these ridges, in a book previously
referred to in the following words, and find no need to alter them
here. “The ridges and adjoining furrows which cover the palmar
and plantar surfaces of all Primates and a few lower forms in smaller
degree, may be compared to the ridges of a ploughed field over
which some object, as a light roller, has been passed, the effect of
this being to produce a series of ridges with flattened tops. This
can be well seen with a lens when the ridges are examined in profile,
and is their normal condition in man and many lower animals,
in nearly all the palmar, plantar and digital regions.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> The reserva­tion
in the last sentence is not material here.</p>


<h3>The Hand of Man.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 280px;">
<a id="Fig_59"></a>
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" alt="" height="459" width="280" />
<div class="caption"><p class="taj">Fig. 59.—W.&nbsp;K. Right hand draw­ing of pap­il­lary ridges,
made from im­pres­sions.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Beginning with the tips of man’s fingers and excluding the
wonderful patterns which Galton did so much to elucidate and
bring into order, we find the ridges are placed, to a remarkable
extent, parallel with the skin-flexures which will be treated in the
next chapter. I term the thumb and fingers D 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the
sake of accuracy (Fig.&nbsp;59). Over the last joints (distal) of all the
digits the ridges suddenly diverge from their directions in the
patterns of the pulps, and become arranged transversely to the<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
axis of the digits. This arrangement is observed on the remaining
segments of the digits except, very significantly, on the outer or
radial side of D 2 and the inner or ulnar side of D 5 where they slope
more or less towards the palm. Their lines thus cross slightly
those of the skin-flexures in these small areas. On the radial side
of D 1 this slope appears in a minor degree, but here it coincides
with those of the flexures. On the palm are similar arrangements
of the ridges near the radial and ulnar borders, and especially on the
two great eminences, thenar and hypothenar, also at the bases of
digits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Over the rest of the palm they are arranged
in a longitudinal or oblique direction. These brief descriptions are
enough to show the close correspondence of the arrangement of
the ridges with the flexion of the numerous joints of the hand.
An observer can demonstrate this by holding up the open hand in<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
a good light and flexing the fingers slightly, which brings nearly
all the ridges adjacent to the joints into directions parallel with
one another, the greater lengths of D 3 and 4, and their closer
functional connec­tion with one another, producing thus a transverse
arrangement, and in D 1, 2 and 5 a more oblique one. In the palm
this correspondence of ridges with flexion lines of joints is not found
so much except in the central part of this surface. But the oblique
and longitudinal ridges of the palm where it becomes concave in
the action of folding the hand over a globular object are well shown
there also to correspond with such action.</p>

<p>This general grouping of ridges is seen, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to
belong to all the palms and soles of lower Primates, and the illustrations
given will speak for themselves, so that little need be said
on each.</p>


<h3>Reasons for Arrangement Observed.</h3>

<p>When one discusses the forces in action on man’s hand which
are claimed to have thus arranged the ridges, in regard to the
question of use and habit, little more need be added as to those
of other Primates, and it is because we know more about ourselves
than them, and our own palms and soles are available for inspec­tion,
that I have taken man as the example.</p>

<p>The main question is the old and now familiar one: “Are
these ridges arranged as we see them <i>by</i> use and habit, or adapted
<i>for</i> use?” Dr. Hepburn and the orthodox Selectionist would say
that, of course, their mode of arrangement is an adapta­tion governed
by selection for preventing slipping in the action of grasping an
object by the hand, and in the foot for preventing slipping in walking.
This does not take into account the question as to how the original
slight shifting of the ridges in the earliest man and in lower forms
could have had selective or survival value, for example, the insignificant
sparse groups of ridges on the palm, sole and <i>tips</i> of
the digits in a hedgehog or squirrel. As things are now they <i>do</i>
subserve these purposes. But I think this matter of preven­tion
of slipping has been much exaggerated, though I may be told that
this is a matter of opinion and not a valid argument against the
hypothesis.</p>


<h3>Foot of Man.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
<a id="Fig_60"></a>
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" alt="" height="545" width="210" />
<div class="caption"><p class="taj">Fig. 60 S.&nbsp;K. Right foot draw­ing
of pap­il­lary ridges made from
im­pres­sion.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The point may be best understood by considering the foot of
man, of which Fig.&nbsp;60 shows a good example. The value of the
roughened surface of the foot with its papillary ridges can hardly
have been great, even in the days when man’s foot was naked,
at any rate so little that for him to acquire by a selectional process<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
such a remarkable <i>change</i> of arrangement as we see when we look
at the foot of man and of any other Primate involves on our part
a tremendous stretch of imagina­tion as to its <i>modus operandi</i>.
These low, soft ridges of man’s foot could do little to prevent him
from slipping on such surfaces as
grass, sand, rock, wet or dry, and
from the time when he began to
protect his feet with coverings this
small value would be further
reduced. <i>Underneath his developing
plantar arch it would not exist at
all, and yet here especially he has
changed their direction.</i> As to the
papillary ridges, man’s foot has
sadly embarked on the pathway of
degenera­tion much as his little toe
has done. Not only has he here a
much simpler arrangement than
any ape or monkey, but the
individual ridges are blurred and
flattened on much of the plantar
surface. This comes of his pride in
acquiring his human distinc­tion, or
title of nobility, of a plantar arch
and his coincident increase of
pedestrian locomo­tion. On the
triple bases of support, heel, ball
of great and little toe, the ridges
are still strongly marked and
coarse; transverse on the heel,
whorl-like on the ball of the
great toe, and oblique or nearly
transverse on that of the little
toe. On the rest of the surface
they are vulgarly transverse.
And I may add that the toe-prints
of man are simplicity itself
compared with his finger-prints.
It would seem that this example
of arrangement of ridges on man’s foot is strongly in favour of
the hypothesis that they are so disposed by flexion of the foot
in walking, and not by some need for preven­tion of slipping
under the guidance of selection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span></p>


<h3>Lower Animals.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<a id="Fig_61"></a>
<img src="images/i_161.jpg" alt="" height="399" width="340" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 61.—Slow loris—right foot.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the other end of the scale the scanty ridges of a hedgehog’s
or squirrel’s foot would be negligible in preventing slipping, however
useful they would be, as I hold, as early organs of touch. Between
these extremes the <i>slow loris</i> affords a valuable example to study,
with the help of Fig.&nbsp;61. The foot, as more concerned with preven­tion
of slipping than the hand, is chosen for observa­tion, but with
little exception the hand agrees closely with it. On the tips of
four digits, D 1, 3, 4 and 5, omitting D 2 for the moment, the ridges
are arranged nearly in a longitudinal direction, and would on that
account have little or no effect in preventing slipping of the foot.
If this be disputed one can but reply that if the need of preventing
slipping in this tiny area were to call forth selective value this is not
the arrangement of the ridges that best serves the purpose. It
may be remarked here that the pulps of <i>lemurs</i>, the <i>marmoset</i> and
<i>squirrel monkey</i> all show this indifferent mode of grouping of ridges.
The aborted D 2 of the <i>loris</i>, with its hooked nail overhanging the<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
circular pattern of ridges, is obviously quite unadapted for any
non-slipping effect of its skin, as a glance at the figure shows.
On the remaining segments of the digits the ridges in the main
slope from each side of each digit in the distal direction and fail
here also to obtain the best, or transverse direction for preventing
slipping in locomo­tion. The corresponding surface of D 1 is not
different from its pulp as to direction of ridges, and it is here to be
noted and admitted that when this muscular great toe is tightly
applied to a branch, which from its shape it must cross at a right
angle, the non-slipping effect of the longitudinal ridges would be
very effective. One must then notice that over the middle of the
sole of this foot the ridges have again changed their direction and
lie in a transverse direction. Between this and the basis of the
digits are three fleshy pads and an intervening area of longitudinal
ridges.</p>

<p>The first question that arises in the attempt to analyse so
complex a grouping on a strange member like the foot of a <i>loris</i>
is this—what is the primary function subserved by the ridges
and their mode of arrangement, and what may be their secondary
uses? In the book referred to I have maintained throughout, in
opposi­tion to Mrs. Wilder Harris and others such as Dr. Hepburn,
that the sense of touch is the primary, and preven­tion of slipping
the secondary adapta­tion secured by the ridges. If this be true
(and I know it is <i>sub judice</i>) there is a very clear reason why the
ridges should be longitudinal on the tips of the digits on account
of the better discrimina­tion of small objects secured by this arrangement,
though it does not well assist the <i>loris</i> to avoid slipping.
On D 1, as mentioned, the non-slipping effect is secured by its
ridges, and this digit is necessarily less employed for discrimina­tion
than support. On the other hand the sloping arrangement on the
rest of the segments of D 3, 4, 5 is decidedly less effective in preventing
slipping than a transverse arrangement would have been.
I think I am justified in saying that too much has been made of
this secondary effect of the ridges in the preven­tion of slipping.
I know that the string wound round the handle of a cricket bat is
very effective for its purpose, but one can also understand that a
casual strand wound here and there on the handle as the ridges
are on a <i>hedgehog’s</i> and <i>squirrel’s</i> hand and foot would be of little
use for the purpose.</p>

<p>On the other hand if the view may be entertained that on the
palm and sole of <i>hedgehog</i>, <i>squirrel</i>, <i>loris</i> and man, we have written
in rows of papillary ridges and their modes of arrangement a register
of long-continued flexion of hand and foot in flexion and correlated<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
actions, we find the facts of these and numerous other Primates
agree in a remarkable manner with the hypothesis; whereas the
exclusive non-slipping rival has many awkward facts to explain,
or disregard.</p>

<p>Further as one has always to bear in mind the Mendelian
analysis it should be observed that the extreme variability, within
certain limits, of the arrangements of papillary ridges throughout
the Primates renders the hypothesis of unit-characters segregated,
according to Mendelian laws, wholly inapplicable to the <i>manner
of their arrangement</i> even though perhaps not so to the <i>existence</i>
of papillary ridges.</p>

<p>It may be bluntly asserted that the ridges are arranged as we
find them because, hands and feet being used as they are, the ridges
“can do no other,” and that there’s an end of it, and that we
cannot derive any help as to the origin of specific difference from
such a trifle, the next item on the agenda should be called for. As
a piece of dialectics that would be effective, but if taken literally
it only goes to prove my simple conten­tion.</p>

resembling those of all the <i>apes</i>, <i>monkeys</i> and <i>lemurs</i>, arched groups
on the digits and longitudinal ones on the centre of the palm, both
of these last two being exactly what would be found arising from
the actions of climbing branches and discriminating globular objects
in the palm.</p>

slightly oblique, precisely as one would find this part if the <i>palm</i>
were used very little for grasping boughs and much for discriminating
globular objects procured for its repasts. The wonderful long
digits of the gibbon form its main organ for supporting itself on
branches and swinging its body rapidly from branch to branch, and
the arched or nearly transverse ridges on the digits are
placed just as the endless use of them for this purpose would
be likely to follow from it. This example is a very clear one
for showing, if it exist, the effect of use and habit on the disposi­tion
of the ridges.</p>

<h3>Some Undesigned Experiments in Ridges.</h3>

<p>This section of the subject has afforded a good supply of
indirect evidence, but so far no direct proof that papillary ridges<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
can be created and disposed in their lines by pressure, friction and
response. The clearest case is one I brought forward at the
Zoological Society of London in 1905, and which was published in
its proceedings of April 18th. It was an instance of the hand of a
<i>chimpanzee</i> with papillary ridges produced in an aberrant or
abnormal situation by walking, and was given as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="ml2em">“In the course of an examina­tion of the papillary ridges
in some specimens of anthropoid apes and monkeys certain
groups of ridges were found on the <i>extensor</i> surface of the
terminal phalanges of the hand, apparently identical with
those of the palmar and plantar surfaces. Three specimens
of chimpanzee living in the Society’s menagerie were examined,
of the ages: one year eight months, two-and-a-half years and
six years. In the oldest of these, called “Mickie,” the ridges
were definite and well-developed, on the second, third and
fourth digits on both hands; in the youngest specimen, “Jack,”
they were absent; and in “Jimmie,” two-and-a-half years
old, they were small and ill-defined, as if in process of
development.</p>

</table></div>

<p class="ml2em"><i>In these three specimens ridges were absent from the corresponding
surfaces of the foot.</i></p>

<p class="ml2em">“The well-defined longitudinal direction of the ridges
in “Mickie” is worth notice. It must be remembered in
this connec­tion that a chimpanzee walks with the extensor
surfaces of the phalanges touching the ground and the digits
turned inwards, so that their long axis are at right angles to
the line of progression of the animal, and accordingly the ridges
of this part also occupy the same relative position. There is
no correla­tion in this instance between the act of prehension
and the direction of the ridges, though it agrees closely with
the general rule which obtains in so many regions, that the
ridges lie at right angles to the line of incidence of the
predominating pressure on the part.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span></p>

<p>In this example of ridges developed on an abnormal situation we
see what is, perhaps, an undesigned experiment as to the produc­tion
of ridges by a more frequent habit of walking in captivity than
would be found to occur in the wild state, for, as Lydekker says
in the <i>Royal Natural History</i>, Vol.&nbsp;I, p.&nbsp;27, “When the chimpanzee
goes on all-fours, he generally supports himself on the backs of his
closed fingers rather than on the palm of the hand (see Fig.&nbsp;6 of the
illustra­tion on p.&nbsp;15) and
he goes <i>sometimes</i> on the
soles of his feet and <i>sometimes</i>
on his closed toes.”</p>

<p>I have underlined
purposely this word “sometimes,”
for in the instance
I have described, not only
the presence of the ridges
and their direction on the
backs of the fingers but
their absence on the backs
of the toes is significant,
and I suggest that the
<i>chimpanzees</i> examined have
not sufficiently often exposed
the backs of their
toes to pressure and friction
for the produc­tion of ridges,
whereas those on the backs
of the fingers have done so.
Another point worth notice
is that in the oldest of the
three <i>chimpanzees</i>, “Mickie,”
æt six years, the greatest
number of ridges is present;
in “Jimmie,” æt two-and-a-half
years, they were
“small and ill-defined as if in process of development,” and in
“Jack,” æt twenty months they were absent. This would agree at
any rate with the hypothesis that the element of time and frequent
repeti­tion of stimuli enter into the causation of aberrant ridges.</p>

<p>A similar condition, with aberrant papillary ridges, has been
found on the digits of the hand of the <i>orang</i>.</p>

<p>On the heel of adult man ridges are found surrounding it, of
the average depth of one inch from the plantar surface, and in one<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
particular case of a woman aged forty-nine, the depth of this area
on each foot measured was one and a half inches from the plantar
surface.</p>

<p>The extensor surface, or back, of the little toe shows ridges
when it is distorted by ill-fitting boots.</p>

<p>In man ridges frequently appear on the radial side of the back
or extensor surface of the index finger to nearly the middle line
of the finger, and this is often more on the right than the left hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

FLEXURES OF THE PALM AND SOLE.</h2>


<p>Those flexures of the palmar and plantar skin which are called
by Galton chiromantic creases, and said by him to be no more
significant to others than palmists than the creases of old clothes,
have received a remarkable amount of pseudo-scientific attention
since earliest times in Chinese and Greek history. The former
even added podoscopy to their chiromancy. The line of life, the
line of the head, the line of the heart, the line of fortune and that
of the liver, figure freely in fortune-telling of modern drawing-rooms
by women who ought to be in Holloway gaol, but are not. The
gipsies, their predecessors and equally honest teachers, did not
employ such high-sounding words, but I believe that by observing
closely the bearing, looks, dress and manner of their dupes, while
pretending to study their palms, both classes of practitioners, like
phrenologists, are able to tell a good deal of what their customers
<i>are</i>, and being shrewd persons they are able to guess pretty well
what they <i>will be and will do</i>.</p>

<p>I agree with Galton that these creases of hand and foot are
no more significant than those of an old coat-sleeve, a pair of
trousers, or boots; but they are not less significant of certain muscular
habits of the wearers of those articles<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span></p>

<p>The flexures in question are in line with the subjects of the
two preceding chapters, and require little more descrip­tion in detail
than is afforded by the accompanying illustra­tion of mammalian
hands and feet.</p>


<h3>Description of Flexures.</h3>

<p>There are two classes which may be conveniently called here
Primary and Secondary, the latter being too variable and accidental
for further notice. The former lie in three main directions and are
longitudinal, oblique or transverse. They represent in graphic
characters the nature and degree of the functions exercised by<span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
muscles moving the joints which underlie them, and are often
called “flexion-lines.” They are “folds so disposed that the
thick skin shall be capable of bending in grasping while it at the
same time requires to be tightly bound down to the skeleton of
the hands and feet, so as to prevent slipping of the skin which would
necessarily lead to insecurity of prehension, just as the quilting
and buttoning down of the covers of furniture by upholsterers
keeps them from slipping. For this purpose the skin is tied by
fibres of white fibrillar
tissue to the deep
layer of the dermis
along the lateral and
lower edges of the
palmar fascia and to
the sheaths of the
flexor tendons. The
folds, therefore, which
are disposed for the
purpose of making the
grasp secure, vary with
the relative lengths of
the metacarpal bones,
with the mutual relations
of the sheaths
of the tendons and
the edge of the
palmar and plantar
fascia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
sulci are emphasised
because the subcutaneous
fat, which is
copious in order to
pad the skin for the
purpose of holding,
being restricted to
the interval between
the lines along which
the skin is tied down, makes these intervals project, and
these are the monteculi.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span></p>

<p>This account of them from a leading anatomist shows that
not for nothing have these creases been evolved. They are
inherited, have an important function and are worthy of study in<span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
their humble way: they may be even dignified with the name
“character.”</p>

<p>They are often double over the joints of the fingers and toes,
but, from the functional point of view and for simplicity, may be
reckoned as single.</p>


<h3>Chief Types.</h3>

<div class="caption"><p class="tac">Fig. 71.—Flexures on palm of right hand.
Drawing made from impression.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most common types of them in the hand of man are
shown in the example given in Fig.&nbsp;71.</p>

<p class="ml2em">1. A flexure over each phalangeal joint.</p>

<p class="ml2em">2. A flexure at the bases of the digits.</p>

<p class="ml2em">3. A flexure over the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of D 2, 3, 4
and 5 with an oblique direction, called <i>linea mensalis</i>.</p>

<p class="ml2em">4. A flexure over these same joints and oblique in direction,
but nearer to the wrist—the <i>linea cephalica</i>. These
flexures 3 and 4, though arising from the flexion of one
set of joints should be looked at as separate folds because
of their time-honoured popular names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span></p>

<p class="ml2em">5. A curving flexure surrounding the thenar eminence,
extending from the centre of the wrist along the palm
and terminating at the radial border.</p>

<p class="ml2em">6. Variable longitudinal and oblique flexures not specified,
which I have called secondary.</p>

<h3>Meaning.</h3>

<p>Whatever be the meaning and origin of these flexures they
are not mere folds such as one makes in a garment and leaves it so.
Action, function and fitting of the structures of the hand and foot
are involved in their history. They may loosely be termed
“ergographs” without any reference to the exact measurement
of work done. No proper idea can be formed of them if the original
function and evolution of the walking-pads of earlier mammals
be omitted. If one goes back and back until one reaches some
lowly marsupial as a <i>vulpine phalanger</i>, or insectivore such as a
common <i>hedgehog</i>, one may even metaphorically see these animals<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
being fitted by a shoemaker with rude shoes or walking-pads for
the better locomo­tion on or under ground, or in the branches of
trees. These pads are projecting masses of hard fat with fibrous
tissue interspersed and they early become fitted or adapted <i>to</i> or <i>by</i>
the use to which they are put. It is impossible to suppose that
certain rudimentary pads are devised by selective processes prior
to the altered habits of walking of the animal that acquires them.
From the shoemaking point of view the fashion is rough and
generalised, and the changing habits of the animal adapt the shoe
by degrees to the function employed, much as many a private
soldier knows to his cost that he has had to adapt slowly and
painfully his army boot to his particular foot. This process in an
early pedestrian mammal involves the breaking up and limiting
of the rudimentary pads by sulci in the dense skin, and the process
of struggle and adjustment between the pads and their bordering
furrows issues in the characteristic flexure of each mammal. From
experiences in the human body one knows how easily fibrous
adhesions between the skin and deeper parts, notably in cases of
Dupuytren’s contrac­tion of the palmar fascia, are formed by close
apposi­tion of the two layers. Such adhesion is precluded when
much movement of the part occurs, but <i>ex-hypothesi</i> the rudimentary<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
flexures are distinguished by absence of movement, and the conditions
for fixing down the deeper layers of the skin to the bones
beneath are clearly present. That these are not indifferent structures
is evident from what Macalister says, and though they be
small or even trivial may be held to have acquired at some time or
other selective value. Their early stages would necessarily be
too tentative, varied and slight to acquire such value.</p>

mechanism of the Primate hand and
foot. The general similarity, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, of the flexures of the
palm and sole in Primates is very
noticeable, and is associated with the
strong prehensile power of the
foot of all the forms below man.
In the cases of the two apes
shown in this series, the resemblance is still well marked,
more so even in the chimpanzee than the gibbon, so that
the disappearance from the sole of man’s foot of any
important flexure is very significant of his loss of prehensile
and gain of locomotive perfec­tion, and I find it impossible to
conceive any process of evolutionary change where a loss of the<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
flexures of a prehensile foot could come under the power of selection,
on its own merits. On the other hand this remarkable instance of
disuse of a formerly useful structure is adequately accounted for
by the evolution of an organ like the human foot which in course
of long periods of time became an organ of one function. Weismann
might score a point over Spencer from his laboured explanations
of man’s dwindling little toe, but here, I submit, he would have
had to take refuge in silence, and pass to characters of a higher
and more debateable kind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

THE EVOLUTION OF A BURSA.</h2>


<p>A bursa exercises a function in the animal body which is the
direct opposite of that shown to belong to the flexures of the hand
and foot. Whereas the latter are adapted to the preven­tion of
slipping in the act of prehension, bursæ are delicate contrivances
for producing the maximum effect of sliding, within certain limits,
between two opposed surfaces, either between the skin and a hard
surface beneath it, between two muscles, or a tendon as it moves
over a bone. As they are very variable and most of them are
inherited and congenital, while some are produced only in the lifetime
of the individual, they are useful for considera­tion in regard
to the questions of transmission of modifications and of the origin
of initial variations. Their degree of utility ranges, for example,
in man, from that of the prepatellar bursa without which no useful
movement of the knee-joint is imaginable, to the insignificant
bursa which may or may not be found on the dorsal surface of a
phalangeal joint of the foot. The principle laid down by Lyell, to
which allusion has been made elsewhere, that is, of “explaining
changes in the surface of the earth by reference to causes now in
action,” is applicable in this small department of the evolution of
a minor structure of the animal body. As man furnishes the largest
of all collections of these lubricating organs, his skeleton and skeletal
muscles will form the main subject of this chapter, and I venture,
if one may say so, to “Lyell” them. None of the sections of this
book except that on the mammalian hair affords so simple and easy
a field for watching in operation certain mechanical forces. We
may here go down to the potter’s house and watch him moulding
his clay, or the cobbler his leather. So much are bursæ in the human
body under the power of extraneous forces that I venture to say
that if some young surgeon of an inquiring mind were to choose
a place and time when the Honourable and Vigilant Stephen
Coleridge was out of the way, and were to produce in a young
<i>chimpanzee</i> under an anæsthetic a “greenstick fracture” of his
radius and ulna, immobilising it at a right angle for a month, the
animal would exhibit at his death some years later a highly developed<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
bursa over the bony protuberance nearly as good as the olecranon
bursa on the uninjured side, and better than that of the injured
limb. As I have reason to know the meticulous vigilance of this
professional and expert humanitarian I hasten here to say in advance
that I do not recommend this experiment, not because it would
not be entirely justifiable, but because nature herself in the highest
Primate has produced many undesigned experiments of nearly
equal value, as I hope to show.</p>


<h3>Bursæ Described.</h3>

<p>Broadly considered a bursa is a sac lined by synovial membrane,
and an extreme example of the simplest form in which it is found
may be said to be that of the condition found in a domestic dog.
Under its skin, except on such regions as the snout, the tail and the
feet, there is hardly a place where a bursal surface does not exist.
Here and there trabeculæ may divide the great sac imperfectly,
but from the protective and selective point of view this mechanism
under a dog’s skin may be compared to the oil with which an Indian
criminal lubricates his naked body so as to elude capture. To us
who are too familiar with dog-fights (to which the Hon. Bertrand
Russell likened the recent Great War, as we all remember) and who
know how much noise and ferocious attempts are made by the
warriors to bite one another, and how little success they achieve,
the beautiful adapta­tion of nature in the dog far surpasses that of
the Indian criminal. Indeed the latter may well have been suggested
by the former.</p>

<p>Between such a simple and undifferentiated bursal surface
as this and another such as the small but essential bursa under
the tendo achillis there are endless variations adapted to particular
uses and regions.</p>

<p>The descrip­tion of bursæ given by Macalister is too clear and
good not to be given in his own words<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span></p>

<p class="ml2em">“Synovial membranes are found either as the lining of
joints, or as <i>Bursæ</i>, which are closed sacs (<i>a</i>) between contiguous
soft parts, or (<i>b</i>) beneath soft parts which glide tensely
over a bone. Bursæ are formed around and beneath tendons
in the neighbourhood of joints; and the hard part on which
the tendon plays is often invested with a layer of cartilage
over which the synovial membrane does not extend. When
they completely surround tendons, as in the finger and toes
they are called <i>thecæ</i> or sheaths, and the tendons are connected
to the sheaths by synovial reflections. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
bursæ lie between exposed areas of skin and projecting bony
points, such as the patella, olecranon, ankles, etc.</p>

<p class="ml2em">“Their (synovial) membrane differs from the synovial
membrane of joints in not having so continuous or definite
an endothelial lining; indeed, while some bursæ, such as that
beneath the ligamentum patellæ, have a more or less regular
lining of regular endothelium, others have only elongated
connective cells forming an imperfect lamella, and there are
all possible gradations met with between the regular saccular
bursa, and a loose meshwork of areolar tissue of which the
bursa is only a specialisa­tion. Bursæ may be (1) subcutaneous,
(2) subfascial, (3) between two tendons, or (4) between tendons
and subjacent ligaments or bone. Of these, some communicate
with the neighbouring joints always, some occasionally, and
some never. Bursæ underlying parts which have an extensive
range of motion are <i>unilocular</i>, with a single cavity. Bursæ
spread over an extensive surface, and whose walls move but
little on each other, are often divided by imperfect fibrous
septa, and are called <i>multilocular</i>. Almost all the lesser
bursæ are unilocular, most of the subcutaneous bursæ are
multilocular.”</p>

<p>Now if one were not engaged upon such a problem as that of
initiative in evolution and in trying to give examples of it there
would be no Gordian knot to cut, and the condensed statement
of Macalister might be simply taken as an accepted account of the
manner in which reading between the lines a bursa is formed in the
animal body. But, when an hypothesis such as the present is in
question, one may not cut the Gordian knot in this way, and must
produce briefly certain observations of the process, not only those
known in man by anatomists and surgeons but also some found in
lower Primates.</p>

<p>I calculate that there are at least fifty-two separate bursæ
(about one hundred on the two sides of the body) in the normal
or fully developed state, though of these many will be found either
absent or with very little of the full structure of a bursa. One small
but significant point may be referred to here. We are all familiar<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
with the prominence of the knuckles of the hand and the very
efficient bursæ which cover them, but most persons do not recognise
that the foot has no such knuckles (or prominent metatarso-phalangeal
joints) and no bursæ over these joints, except that
of the great toe which happens to be very much more exposed to
friction and has a much greater range of action than the other four
metatarso-phalangeal joints. This might be called by some persons
a beautiful bit of adapta­tion <i>for</i> locomo­tion and by others an
equally admirable bit of adapta­tion produced <i>by</i> locomo­tion.</p>


<h3>Examination of Two Still-born Children.</h3>

<p>Some further light may be thrown upon the human bursæ by
an examina­tion of two still-born children I dissected in 1908 in
Lewisham infirmary, and give here the results as to the more
important subcutaneous bursæ.</p>

<p><i>Male Child</i>: full term.</p>

<div class="ml2em">
<div><i>Shoulder</i>: bursæ under acromion processes absent.</div>

<div><i>Elbow</i>: bursæ over outer condyle of humerus present.</div>

<div><i>Wrist</i>: bursæ over styloid process of ulna present.</div>
<div class="ml4em"> "  "  "   "  of radius present.</div>

<div class="ml55hi"><i>Hand</i>: bursæ over metacarpo-phalangeal joints D 1 absent,
D 2, 3, 4, 5 present.</div>
<div class="ml52hi">bursæ over phalangeal joints, first set present,
second set absent.</div>

<div class="ml55hi"><i>Hip</i>: bursæ over anterior superior spine of the ilium both
absent.</div>

<div><i>Knee</i>: prepatellar bursæ well-developed.</div>

<div><i>Ankle</i>: bursæ over both malleoli present:</div>
<div class="ml3em">bursæ beneath tendo achillis well-developed.</div>

<div><i>Great toe</i>: plantar bursa present.</div>

<div><i>Little toe</i>: plantar bursa absent.</div>

joint present.</div>
<div class="ml52hi">D 2, 3, 4, 5 bursæ over metatarso-phalangeal joints

<div class="ml72hi">D 2, 3, 4, none over either of the phalangeal

<div class="ml72hi">D 5 bursa present over the first and absent
over the second phalangeal joint.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span></p>

<p>This example of a still-born, but otherwise normal infant
illustrates well the previous statement that certain bursæ are
congenital and others of less functional importance are formed
after birth. Whereas the olecranon, wrist, patellar, ankle and
tendo achillis bursæ are fully formed, those under the acromion
processes, one of those of the condyles of the femur, and the digits
of the hand, those over the superior anterior spines of the ilium
and those of the foot are little if at all developed in this case.</p>

<p>Another still-born child at seven months was also dissected
and this had well-formed prepatellar bursæ, scanty ones over the
olecranon processes, also over the small joints of the hand and
foot where they were difficult to isolate and over the malleoli they
were only slightly developed.</p>

<p>A fœtus in spirit I examined and found no commencement of a
prepatellar bursa.</p>


<h3>Examination of Living Primates.</h3>


<p><i>Anthropoid Apes.</i></p>

<p>Eight of these I examined during life at the London Zoological
Society’s gardens in 1908, four <i>chimpanzees</i>, two <i>orangs</i> and two
<i>gibbons</i>. These afforded the opportunity of ascertaining by means
of touch the presence, and in a minor degree the size and efficiency
of the main subcutaneous bursa, just as one can do this in a human
subject. The <i>chimpanzees</i> were A, aged thirteen; B, aged seven;
C, aged three; and D, aged two-and-a-half years; the orangs E,
aged thirteen; F, aged three years; the gibbons G and H both
two to three years.</p>

<p>These eight specimens possessed good examples of the leading
subcutaneous bursæ over the olecranon process, the styloid process
of the ulna, the patella and both malleoli.</p>

<p>The smaller and less definite bursæ gave the following
results.</p>


<p class="mb-05em"><i>Chimpanzees.</i></p>

<div class="ml2em">

<h3>Further Undesigned Experiments.</h3>

<p>The preceding facts as to the natural history of bursæ in man
and some lower Primates, even if they stood alone, are enough
to produce convic­tion as to the manner in which bursæ of all degrees
of perfec­tion are formed by function, and point to the origin of the
initial stages of these structures. But they do not stand alone, for
in man there have been carried out certain undesigned experiments
in a similar direction, comparable to those described in the sections
on direction of hair and arrangement of papillary ridges. These<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
demonstrate the fact that frequent friction of skin over a hard
surface has the power of producing adventitious bursæ in regions
where they are not found in the normal state.</p>

<p>These adventitious bursæ are the <span class="nowrap">following:—</span></p>

<p>In the first place certain normal bursæ in important situations
are frequently so much enlarged by the constant irrita­tion of
pressure and friction that they become considerably enlarged.
This enlargement may go on to definite pathological changes and
thus come under the care of surgeons.</p>

<div>They are Prepatellar bursæ—“housemaid’s knee.”</div>
<div class="ml62hi">Olecranon bursæ—“student’s elbow” and “miner’s elbow.”</div>
<div class="ml4em">Tuber ischii bursæ—“weaver’s bottom.”</div>

<p>These may be called “occupa­tion-bursæ” and may be classed
with three other well-known adventitious bursæ which are formed
on the shoulder in “deal runners,” on the scalp in “fish porters”
and in the back of the neck in Covent Garden porters, known as
a “hummy.” Entirely new bursæ are formed also over the cuboid
bone in talipes equino-varus, over the internal condyles of the femur
in bad cases of knock-knee from friction of one joint against the
other, over the prominent vertebrae in a humpback. A structure
closely resembling a bursa and arising from similar causes to those
producing adventitious bursæ is found in unreduced dislocations
or ununited fractures.</p>

<p>A small example of an adventitious bursa came under my
notice. A woman, E.&nbsp;L., aged 49, had remarkable enlargement of
the metatarso-phalangeal joint of her great toe of the left foot,
and over this joint was formed a well-marked bursa on the dorsal
surface. The right foot showed a much less prominent joint and
only a very slight development of the corresponding bursa.</p>

<p>This instance of a bursa-like structure being produced in
unreduced dislocations and ununited fractures suggests the concep­tion
which I here propose, but do not attempt to verify that <i>all
joints in all animal forms from the lowest up to man have been
evolved in a manner to which this pathological experiment may give
a clue</i>.</p>

<p>A remarkable case reported by Sir William MacEwen in the
Royal Society’s <i>Phil. Transactions</i>, Series B, Vol. 199, pp.&nbsp;253,
279, is worth referring to in this connec­tion. It was a case of a
growth of bone in muscle connected with an old injury to the thigh
of a man 38 years old, and healthy. At the operation performed by
the author of the paper the tumour was found to be movable, partly
attached to the fascia lata of the thigh, and the upper part of the<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
tumour moved on the lower. It was found that the tumour consisted
of two parts, the upper three-and-a-half and the lower seven inches
long, altogether a mass about ten inches in length. Muscular
bundles of the vastus externus were included in this ossific formation,
one passed through a tunnel in the bone through which it
worked, and the sides of it were polished. <i>At the point where the
newly formed bone came in contact the surfaces fitted each other and
were polished as if they were covered with cartilage, and were here
surrounded by a capsule.</i> (Italics not in original.) This fibrous
covering when opened was seen to contain a thin serum, which,
though not of the consistence of synovial fluid, still aided in
lubricating the polished surfaces as they played over one another.</p>

<p>A similar case was reported also by Dr. C. Paterson, surgeon
to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.</p>

<p>A very interesting address by the Hunterian Professor, Mr.
Jonathan Hutchinson, was given in February, 1917, on Dupuytren’s
work, especially in the discovery of the cause and treatment of
the contrac­tion of palmar fascia known by his name. Professor
Hutchinson described his method of curing this by the removal
of the head of the first phalanx, and showed excellent results and
evidence of the formation of a perfect new joint to take the place
of the old distorted one, and the fingers were as efficient as in the
normal state in the exercise of flexion. He gives photographs of
the hand some months after the operation showing it to be capable
of easy and full extension as well as of flexion. This again agrees
well with the cases of Sir W. MacEwen and Dr. Paterson of the
formation of a functional joint <i>by</i> use and habit.</p>

<p>Another distinguished Hunterian Professor A. Keith, also gave
two lectures in January, 1918, on the “Introduc­tion of the Modern
Practice of Bone-grafting,” which, in its modern form, he assigns
to the credit of Sir William MacEwen. He lays great stress on
the important work performed in such cases by the osteoblasts
without whose living and formative action these results could not
be obtained. He explains how necessary it is that these living
elements should be stimulated into action by <i>work</i>. They thrive
only so long as they have work to do. Another surgeon, Ollier,
“wondered why the fragments of bone which he had succeeded in
raising from slips of periosteum planted beneath the scalp or
amongst muscles ceased to grow and tended to disappear. These
bony grafts withered because they were not subjected to the strains
and stresses which rouse the activity of osteoblasts.” MacEwen,
“by a fortunate chance, planted his tibial grafts in a situation
where they soon became subjected to muscular strains and stresses.<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
In a short time bony fragments gathered from the legs of six boys
became intrinsic parts of the humerus of a seventh; from the moment
of primary union the bone cells of the graft were brought under the
stimulating impulses of the biceps and triceps. Osteoblasts are
the obedient slaves of muscles; <i>muscular dominance is their breath
of life</i>.” (Italics not in the original.)</p>

<p>“Wolff was the first to devote thirty years of constant work
and observa­tion to prove that the shape and structure of growing
bones and adult bones depend on the stresses and strains to which
they are subjected. By altering the lines of stress the shape of a
bone can be changed.”</p>

<p>Wolff’s law is simply this: “Osteoblasts at all times build
and unbuild, according to the stresses to which they are subjected.”</p>

<p>Professor Keith says further: “We are driven, as I have
pointed out in a previous lecture, to look for the primary cause,
not in the bones, but in the muscles, particularly in those which are
tonically and constantly in action so long as we are standing.”</p>

<p>A terse expression of Wolff’s law is quoted from Dr. John
B. Murphy, of Chicago: “The amount of growth in a bone depends
upon the need for it.”</p>

<p>A remarkable illustra­tion of a similar process is given in the
construc­tion of sponges by the scleroblasts and it is stated: “The
soft walls of this sponge are constantly exposed to the force of
moving waters, and we shall see that the spicule-builders—the
scleroblasts—are endowed with the same properties as osteoblasts—the
powers of fashioning and depositing the elements of the skeleton
so that the sponge can best resist the forces to which it is habitually
exposed.”</p>

<p>One more important quotation from this lecture will suffice.
“No one who has watched the behaviour of scleroblasts and marked
the design in their workmanship can doubt that they have acquired
certain characteristic qualities, chief of which is a sensitiveness to
vibrations—to stresses. We see them build the same form of
spicules as their ancestors, and therefore must suppose that their
building quality is a gift of inheritance. We see them alter their
mode of building as stresses change; we must therefore suppose
that their inherited powers can be changed by the circumstances
under which they work.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the action of the scleroblasts of sponges I have
only to point out that the cautious words of Professor Keith on the<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
treacherous ground of inheritance amount to the very same concep­tion
of personal selection and inheritance as are involved in the
term “educability” of Sir E. Ray Lankester. Whether or not
in the case of sponges this be a complete account of the matter it
at any rate is a very important piece of evidence, if valid, for
selection. Whether or not further it is a piece of evidence for a
Mendelian factor implicit in the primordial sponges and released
by some loss of inhibiting factors, as Professor Bateson would
probably claim, is another and far more imaginative concep­tion.
The mere neo-Lamarckian with the aid of personal selection fails
to see any difficulty in realising the wonderful process described
by Professor Keith.</p>

<p>An apology must be offered here to the patient reader for the
introduc­tion under the heading of the “Evolution of a Bursa”
of the apparently alien subjects of bone-grafts, artificial new joints
and sponge-spicules, but I have hazarded the guess that all joints
in all animals have been fashioned—“forged by the incident of
use,” to employ a fine phrase of Professor Macdonald’s in another
connec­tion—in slow but intelligible ways by use, and that in them,
as elsewhere, function has preceded structure. This arose so simply
out of the story of the bursæ that I ventured to digress as aforesaid
rather than make it the subject of a separate section.</p>


<h3>The Significance of the Proceeding.</h3>

<p>The foregoing slender contribu­tion to the comparative anatomy
and physiology of bursæ is sufficient to show that at certain
important and “critical” points in the mammalian anatomy,
efficient bursæ are always present. One cannot indeed conceive
the function of the parts involved being carried on at all without
these ingenious contrivances, and no doubt can exist that in certain
of the leading bursæ selection guides and guards, while use and habit
maintain them. Over such as these “dominance” or the appearance
of mutations might perhaps be supposed to preside, and
possibly some useful statistical results might arise from their study
from these points of view. But, between these major bursæ in
man and lower Primates and the undifferentiated sacs which hardly
deserve the name of bursæ, there is a perfect little host of insignificant
structures, which at the first attempt at dominion over them on
the part of Mendel or de Vries would hoist the standard of revolt.
These would even refuse allegiance to Personal Selection under the
persuasive banner, “Educability,” which however valuable elsewhere,
must stand aside in this little province of Nature. I have
thus attempted to “Lyell” this body of facts. Basing the state<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>ment
on an analysis of a considerable mass of small facts which
no one disputes I claim that the modifications drawn from normal
anatomy on the one hand and on the other adventitious structures,
produced by acknowledged mechanical forces, are examples of the
transmission of modifications, and illustrate the mode of formation
of certain initial variations. In other regions where Plasto-diēthēsis,
as I conceive it, is at work in producing adapted organisms,
there may be included in the hyphenated area certain factors of
heredity, Mendelian, mutational and others, but not in this group.
This is merely an assertion of an opinion though I submit that there
is good evidence for it. Not even the hardest hearted Weismannian,
Mendelian or mutationist, and not even the biometrician can
refuse to this poor little province the required time and mechanical
forces, and, unless an opponent can offer some explana­tion more
consistent with the facts than that here offered, the proof of causation
is as sound as that shown in the larger one of the direction of hair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

THE PLANTAR ARCH.</h2>


<p>The principle of Lyell cannot be applied to this section of my
subject for it is unique in the animal world. There is here a simple
compila­tion of facts such as the medical schoolboy is supposed to
know, and only requires for its setting forth the valuable expert
knowledge of our predecessors in anatomy. It is indeed a pedestrian
chapter.</p>

<p>Man alone possesses this mark of a high lineage, and it adds
point to Shakespeare’s descrip­tion of man as “paragon of animals,”
and Huxley’s “a superb animal, head of the sentient world.”
For winning this integral part of a perfect walking-foot man must
stoop to conquer; he must descend from the trees in order that
he may have life and liberty; whether he bears the ancient surname
of Tarsius or the more honoured one of Pithecus matters not.
Names had not in those early times usurped that tyranny over
man’s mind which they have done among his modern descendants.
He came into that terrestrial kingdom which was to be his own
with many a limita­tion, but with the promise and potency of an
unexampled evolution, when he assumed more fully the erect
posture and saw that his inheritance was very good. Neither
then nor since has he ever reached the fleetness of foot of the
Thibetan wild ass, the astonishing sense of smell of the dog or
horse, the keen sight of the hawk, or the climbing power of that
simian family upon whom he turned his back as on a poor relation.
He became <i>par excellence</i> the walking biped of earth, as, even
with greater value to his mastery of the world he learned to talk
in articulate language. A walking animal and a talking animal,
with vast stretches of time for training these new powers of his,
he became modified into the variegated human stocks, black, yellow
and white, that now inhabit the earth.</p>


<h3>A Crumbling Arch.</h3>

<p>A digression, I hope, will be pardoned here before the value
and beauty of the plantar arch and its mode of forging are described,
and it is possible the latter may add some force to the former.
Scientific (or, must I say?) semi-scientific writings are not concerned<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
with the snobbishness of much of the pride of birth which still
survives among us. But I would indeed think myself to be doing
“my bit” if I could induce the present genera­tion of young women
and men to think highly of their plantar arches, nobler evidence of a
“good” family than soft fair skin, taper fingers, Grecian nose,
slender waist or that hair of which the decaying line of the long-haired
kings of old France were too proud. For one reason or
another, probably analogous to those for which he has lost so
much the vigour of his hair of the scalp, or his dwindling wisdom-teeth
and shrinking little toes, in other words, racial degenera­tion,
modern man seems to be losing his plantar arch. For about three
years I have made careful but saddening study of the ankles and
feet of young women, and have embodied it in a variety of journals.
This study has included about two thousand examples in young
women of incipient or advanced flat-footedness as revealed, nay,
flaunted before us in our towns and villages. This revela­tion has
been offered by women’s shortened skirt, so that one can now note
for oneself the ugly and disabling ankles and feet in the streets of
any town, without the complicated business of a surgical examina­tion.
Such an examina­tion, as it happens, and as it is usually
undertaken, serves only to show a moderately advanced degree of
this deformity, indeed, just so much as induces a patient to go to a
doctor for relief of pain or obvious deformity. This is wholly
insufficient for the study of a defect which in the various degrees
of its development affects nearly 90 per cent. of all youngish women
so far observed and noted. The doctors may—or may not—cure
this evil, but they are not likely to find time even to discover during
their strenuous lives, the great spread of this physical defect. But
the merciful ukases of fashion, from Paris or elsewhere, and the
obvious benefits, for once, of a fashion, are so powerful that the
short skirt has remained with us for several years past and does
not seem likely to go. I can only hope it will last until women
who lead their sex in these days become ashamed of the feet of their
sisters and their own, and make a forcible attack upon the Health
Minister or Minister of Education, or both, so that systematic
foot-drill in all elementary schools may be established. No other
means than this, added to improved general health, can be conceived
as able to correct so widely spread a deformity. I do not desire
to be considered as making an attack on the bodily charms of
women, for whose multifarious attractions I yield to none in sincere
regard. But here is the revela­tion, here are the cases walking
unashamed before us, and if the skirts <i>should</i> lengthen again and
cruelly hide up the evil, no one will be induced again to take up the<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
unpopular attitude of saying that nearly all young women have
feet that are deformed and ugly and, therefore, more or less inefficient.
There is, alas! only too much reason to know that the
evil is great among the better class, even of boys, for in 1919 Captain
Coote said publicly at a Schoolmasters’ Conference that fully
30 per cent. of the new boys entering leading public schools had
flat-foot, and Captain Coote, the highest exponent of physical
training in the Navy, knows a flat-foot when he sees it. The
measures here suggested in connec­tion with the feet of women
have the great merit that from them boys and girls will alike benefit.</p>


<h3>Non-Arboreal Man.</h3>

<p>Many problems faced non-arboreal man as he descended from
the trees to claim his suzerainty and place of toil. Not least
among them was the question of methods of protec­tion against
the terrible creatures among which he was to live. Their produc­tion
must needs be slow, and for him to meet by “direct action” with
weapons invented <i>ad hoc</i> the fierce large carnivora and clumsy but
dangerous dinosaurs would have proved highly dangerous. Too
long had they been in possession of his Canaan, and he could not
cross his Jordan, walk seven times round their Jericho, blowing
with trumpets of rams’ horns, and on the seventh day march in
and “consolidate his position.” He had first to do what his
descendants have always been bound to do; he had to learn to
walk terrestrially long before he could think and live imperially.
Sufficient for him was the evil of his day, and, as an old arboreal
denizen he had much to learn and not a little to unlearn; and we
know from the prehistoric pictures of his own doings and trophies,
that he did in course of ages learn to walk, run and jump with variety
of step and efficiency unknown in any other Primate group. We can
ask, and we can but supply speculative answers as to the details
of <i>how</i> he did it, but somewhere and at some time he learned first
to become as good a walking animal as later he became a talking
one, and some at any rate of the steps of the process are plain for
all to read to-day.</p>


<h3>How the Arch was Built.</h3>

<p>Did I not know something of the severity of the judges in such
a Court of Appeal as we are facing in this case and of the opposing
counsel—of the jury I have less fear—I should be disposed to settle
on a half-sheet of note-paper the problem that non-arboreal man
settled ages ago for himself on the ground, by a familiar saying.
It really meets the non-scientific mind which is not weighed
down by what Captain Marryat used to call <span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>“top-hamper,”
to answer <i>Solvitur Ambulando</i>. But I hear judges and counsel
both saying “This will never do,” and must address myself
to opening up the case.</p>

<p>If an adventurous gorilla and his mate, whom we may call
gorilla Columbi, had long ago made a bid for a life completely
terrestrial rather than partly arboreal, it is difficult to imagine
how the feet of this pair could have failed to adjust themselves
and their separate tarsal elements to a better if rudimentary form
like that of man, and that their progeny would not have followed
or improved upon this. Professor Keith<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> in his work referred to,
and Professor Wood Jones in <i>Arboreal Man</i>, have much to say on
the evolution of man’s foot and arch, and I mention this <i>ab initio</i>
so as to be free from any supposed claim to originality which is apt
in the present extended range of scientific progress to be as damaging
to a man as for him to proclaim his honesty or a woman her virtue.
And I also formally grant to the Mendelians and Mutationists, without
offence and with some possible relief to their minds, a period
of leave from this poor trench-warfare—<i>Plasto-diēthēsis</i> will not be
obliged to call in at the place of its hyphen any reinforcements
from these of the higher command.</p>

<p>The assumed precursor of our human walker was probably
more highly evolved in his own special line than the real ancestor,
but we have so little yet of discoveries of whole skeletons of earliest
man that the bodily structure of gorilla C. may fairly be taken
as a starting point, indeed he is for this purpose a valuable lay-figure,
almost artistic for once, on which may be draped the following
story of the making of an arch. The ultimate verdict, which
word I use in the old English sense of a “true saying” rather than
the most recent declara­tion of those who “ride on white asses and
sit in judgment,” does not therefore invalidate the verisimilitude
of this picture. One may go farther and affirm that, given certain
anatomical and physiological facts in an earlier Primate stock,
which marvellously resemble those of modern man, and it must
follow as the night the day that his more primitive physical basis
employed in a new mode of progression, that is of terrestrial walking
on two feet, will be converted by use and habit into the construc­tion
of such new formations as will best agree with the new style—in
other words, in this instance, a plantar arch.</p>


<h3>An Unique Phenomenon.</h3>

<p>That a plantar arch is peculiar to man is a matter of fact,
and Lydekker in the <i>Royal Natural History</i>, Vol.&nbsp;I., p.&nbsp;41, says<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
of the gorilla’s foot incidentally “there is no sort of resemblance
to the human instep in the whole foot,” and Professor Keith in
the work referred to “the arch is a human character.” One may
see this for oneself in living apes and monkeys and in the wonderful
series of drawings of apes in all kinds of postures in the <i>Royal
Natural History</i>, and indeed in the feet of dead apes and monkeys.
All Primates other than man walk on a flat sole.</p>


<h3>Equipment.</h3>

<p>Our adventurer starts with the following equipment of tools
for making his arch as he learns to walk entirely on the ground
which it must be remembered he can only do by unlearning <i>pari
passu</i> his highly cultivated power of grasping with his foot. The
old and the new cannot flourish together. The evolving foot of
man is an example of a slow change in the function of an organ and
consequent modifica­tion of certain structures in it. He walks with
his feet turning in, or in the axis of the leg; his great toe is not in
this axis but may even lie at a right angle to the foot; he rests
weight on his heel and even more on the outer border of his sole,
and thus the sole of one foot turns more or less towards the other;
and he puts a good deal of weight on his toes which are frequently
doubled over; and his gait, though erect, is never completely
so, and is clumsy in appearance.</p>

<p><i>Bones</i>: his heel-bone is relatively long and pointed and
slightly arched below; the bones of his great toe are short and thick,
and the other four toes relatively long and slender. You can see
at once it is not primarily a walking foot. Any active boy of
twelve could give him points and a beating in a race for life in the
open. Further, his foot shows a much larger propor­tion of the whole
foot in front of the end of the great toe than is ever seen in man.
The <i>ligaments</i> which bind the joints of his foot together, while
the muscles play upon them, are little different from those he will
require for the girders of his arch, except for such a throwing out
of slips, and shifting under the stresses and strains of such walking
as his new gait involves.</p>

<p>The <i>muscles</i> of his leg and foot are the most important by far
of his original equipment with which to set about making his arch:
he could no more do this out of his present muscles than a Hebrew
could make bricks without clay. It is these variable and plastic
structures which are most readily adapted by use in a fresh direction
or increased degree. He has the great flexors of the ankle and foot
in his poorly-shaped calf (this feature might be adduced as a human
character and studied in this manner if it were not of so elusive<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
a nature) and the long flexors of his four outer toes, the special
long flexor of the great toe, which in his case does not of course act
in the axis of the other metatarsal bones. He is lacking here in
the special detached portion of the <i>flexor accessorius</i>, which eventually
becomes of use in maintaining the arch, between the heel-bone
and the tendons of certain digits. He has, in a measure, the
<i>oblique adductor</i> muscle of the great toe and the <i>transverse adductor</i>
muscle, more for future use perhaps than of much present value.
Like all apes and monkeys he has a <i>peroneus longus</i> with its tendon
passing across the sole from the outer border to the base of the
great toe and a <i>peroneus brevis</i>, both of them for everting the foot
and supinating it. But here again he is lacking, for he has no
little <i>peroneus tertius</i>, which Professor Keith speaks of as a muscle
“peculiar to man” and “a special evertor of the foot”—a muscle
passing from the tendons of the <i>extensors</i> of the toes and inserted
into the little toe. He has also the <i>tibialis anticus</i> and <i>tibialis
posticus</i>, the latter which flexes the ankle on the leg, and the former
which also flexes it and everts the foot; he has also the special
<i>extensors</i> of the toes.</p>

<p>This enumera­tion of the bony, ligamentous, and muscular
possessions of gorilla C. is enough to show that, though he has
little of new tools to make, he has to modify greatly those he
has learnt to use so well, so that one can almost hear him echo the
words of David to Saul as to his new armour.</p>

<p>The problem of an arch remains to be solved by eversion
instead of inversion of the foot, growth in all directions of the heel-bone,
and the enlargement and straightening of the great toe,
and the “setting” of the foot in a certain degree of pronation and
over-extension.</p>


<h3>Description of the Arch.</h3>

<p>The plantar arch is double, but the longitudinal one must
be chiefly considered here. It lies under the concave roof of the
tarsal bones, seven in number, and the metatarsal bones, and rests
in a well-formed foot in front on the heads of the latter, and behind
on the inferior surface of the heel-bone. The <i>astragalus</i> alone of
these bones in contact with those of the leg, acts like a washer to
the ankle joint, and has no muscles attached to it. Three more
of the <i>tarsal</i> bones need reference: these are the three <i>wedge-shaped</i>
bones which have their bases on the dorsal and their apices directed
towards the plantar surface. With such a set of bony tools as
this, all the requisites for an arch are at hand. Let the half-tree,
half-ground walker become a complete ground-walker, and in
the first place the manifest increase of the action of the flexors of<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
the leg will pull to an unusual extent on the <i>tendo achillis</i> and
heel-bone, leading, in accordance with a well-known law, to steady
enlargement of the parts near to which it is attached. The greater
amount of weight thrown henceforth on the heel tends in just the
same direction, indeed, to general enlargement of the whole bone.
The <i>astragalus</i> being in No Man’s Land, so to speak, takes less part
in the change than any other tarsal bone. The <i>wedge-shaped</i>
bones are exactly so constructed as to retreat a little in a dorsal
direction as the modified walking increases under the action of
certain muscles which will later be mentioned. This, in conjunc­tion
with the projec­tion backwards of the heel and the general growth
of the bone, permits, as far as the bony parts go, a gradual hollowing
out of the originally flat plantar surface, and the increasing eversion
of the foot places more weight on the front pier of the arch, that is,
the heads of the <i>metatarsal</i> bones. The squeezing-up process of
the smaller <i>tarsal</i> bones contributes also to the formation of the
transverse arch.</p>

<p>The <i>ligaments</i> need no new invention on his part but only a
more human degree of development, and in particular the <i>calcaneo-navicular</i>
ligament and <i>internal lateral</i> of the ankle undergo in the
human foot great development, and the long plantar ligament,
originally part of the tendon of the <i>gastrocnemius</i>, comes in to
the aid of the arch and goes to bind it together, so that these
humbler structures follow in the wake of the changing and enlarging
bones.</p>

<p>The plantar fascia, though a powerful protective armour for
the deeper parts of the sole, cannot be held to enter into the formation
of the arch. The <i>initiative</i> in this process lies with the muscles,
and, even if neither gorilla C. himself, nor his descendants, had
altered the muscles of his foot and just given up climbing for
walking, there were muscles strong enough and appropriate for
modifying very profoundly his simian foot, though he might not
have arrived at an arch. He or they might have become long-distance
walkers, but never sprinters.</p>

<p>If the sole of the dissected foot is observed it is seen that
the plantar arch lies approximately over a triangle of which the
base is formed by the <i>transverse adductor</i> muscle of the great toe,
across the heads of the metatarsal bones, and the two sides by the
<i>oblique adductor</i> of the great toe and the <i>short flexor</i> of the little toe.
It extends, of course, somewhat further back under the heel-bone,
but this is its highest part.</p>

<p>In the changing foot the <i>tibialis posticus</i>, which was originally
a flexor of the metatarsal bones, obtains a secondary attachment<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
to the <i>scaphoid</i> bone, and the <i>tibialis anticus</i> becomes inserted anew
into the internal <i>wedge-shaped</i> and metatarsal bones. “Both of
these muscles, thus modified, help to maintain the arch of the foot.
So does the tarsal part of the tendon of the <i>tibialis posticus</i>.”
(Keith).</p>

<p>The three <i>peronei</i> muscles, especially the new <i>peroneus tertius</i>,
attached to the little toe, are called in by increased walking to
redress the balance of forces in the foot and produce that eversion,
with some supina­tion, which is essential to the arch. No arch was
possible till these muscles came into some preponderance of action
over the <i>flexors</i>, so beloved of gorilla C. The <i>short flexor of the
digits</i> becomes modified so that its attachment to the tendons of
the <i>long flexors</i> in the sole has its <i>origin</i> completely transferred
to the heel-bone in man (Keith). “It can thus act more powerfully
in maintaining the arch,” and finally the <i>flexor accessorius</i>, a muscle
which cannot fail to surprise the dissector when he first penetrates
into the deep layer of muscles of the sole, and which is a detached
piece of the <i>long flexor of the great-toe</i>, becomes especially well-developed
and helps to maintain the arch.</p>

<p>The order of events then is: first, increased and altered muscular
function; second, growth of bones and adjustment; third, binding
together of these by new or modified ligaments. If it were possible
to separate in this way the age-long formation of such a
living tool as the human foot, this is the order in which alone, I
submit, the sequence of events can be placed. It is a convenient,
because simple and plain example of initiative in evolution, and
I cannot say how much I owe to Professor Keith’s teaching on the
subject<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

MUSCLES.</h2>


<p>A work of great value to the biologist has been written by one
whose work has led him in the widening path of human physiology
and its very title is instinct with meaning. The Integrative action
of the Nervous System may not aid the systematist or the student
of genetics, but for insight into formative powers, where the former
can but record facts and find no interpreta­tion, such a work is
of supreme importance. When the plant sealed its fate and
enclosed itself in a cell-wall and abandoned a life of movement,
it was foreordained that its rival would be that cell and its descendants
which could adopt a free life, and that the future of the world
would lie at the proud foot of that conqueror who could command
and mobilize the resources of a nervous system. And, as we know,
it has fallen to man to receive the rewards of this promise and
potency of a higher life. If one seeks to understand the steps by
which man has arrived at his primacy it can only be by the highway
of nervous progress, however much the tracing of certain connecting
or collateral paths may throw light on contributing causes. So
that man’s place in Nature is nearly synonymous with the structural
evolution of his brain, as Huxley has shown in his clear and simple
manner. Even if man is to remain still an animal Melchisedec for
generations to come, or to put it lower, a foundling, no future
discoveries that can be imagined will disprove Huxley’s declara­tion,
“Evolution is no longer an hypothesis, but an historical fact.”
And yet if man has become adapted to his world, and, in it, crowned
with glory and honour by the unfolding of some original complexity,
or as the result of some fortunate mutations in the distant past,
the human brain, with its cranial capacity of nearly three times the
number of cubic centimetres to that of the gorilla, has been making
false claims to a paramountcy over all factors in the wonderful
initiative of fresh capacities and their mobilisa­tion for conquest.
Nothing less than such a “claim” was understood by the ancients,
and, though metaphysics had to supply the lack of anatomy and
physiology, it has always been held that mind was lord of matter,
and now scientific research has told us why. But no one, even the<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
most hard-shelled scholastic, can refuse to the brain organ its
predominant share in the making of man. This is seen even in the
frigid sphere of science by the difference of interest there is shown
between any great discovery bearing on the evolution of man,
or on some new lower animal form. When Sir. H.&nbsp;H. Johnston
astonished zoologists in 1901 by his discovery and proof of the
existence of an archaic large mammal which had been interned
for an incalculable time in the Semliki Forest, the thrill felt at that
historic meeting passed off very soon when the leading British
biologist had monographed the Okapi, settled its name and surname
and introduced it into text-books. This is never the fate of such as
Pithecanthropus or Eoanthropus dawsoni, or of the more recent
genealogical theory and researches as to arboreal man. The
call of these studies of man’s evolution is felt by all, and the difference
in the two branches of biology may account for what must have
struck many others, that is the neglect of adding the blue ribbon
of science to the honours of the discoverer of the Okapi.</p>

<p>These few trite remarks as to the importance of the nervous
system in the making of man have been introduced here, though
they bear more closely on the next two chapters, because this
importance comes in at every stage of the present treatment of
the origin of modifications in muscle.</p>


<h3>Anatomists’ Views of Muscles.</h3>

<p>There is a very strict and austere custom among anatomists,
which doubtless is in a measure necessary, of insisting upon following
rigorously the homologies of muscles, especially in human anatomy,
and in this branch of a greater subject the canons are followed
to an extent that surprises the seeker after origins. A remarkable
example of this is in a paper by an eminent anatomist, now Professor
at King’s College, Dr. E. Barclay Smith. It is a paper on the
“Morphology of the short extensor of the human fingers.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> He says
“the precise significance of this occasional <i>extensor brevis digitorum
manus</i> is a matter of considerable interest.” He gives four possible
interpretations of this unusual muscle. The last, viz., that it is
derived from a new muscle-germ alone interests us here because of
the remarkable caution and austerity of his remarks on this interpreta­tion.
“If an <i>ext. brevis dig. manus</i> cannot be regarded as an
atavistic anomaly, or as a derivative from any existing musculature,
the only way in which its presence can be accounted for is to suppose
that it is of entirely new origin—the product of a new muscle-germ.<span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
Such an explana­tion is, of course, the last resort, and all other
possible derivations must be disproved before it can be accepted.”
The physiologist would probably think such an interpreta­tion was
the obviously first resort. The same writer discusses at length the
homology of an exceedingly rare anomaly among muscles, the
<i>extensor ossis metacarpi hallucis</i>, and his desire on the one hand to
find a missing parent for Japhet, and his honesty and accuracy on
the other hand lead him to say “even when it is present, it cannot
be regarded as directly atavistic, since it does not represent a
normal mammalian tendency.” And he adds a gentle but remote
sugges­tion—“Brooks certainly describes such a muscle in <i>menobranchus</i>
and <i>hatteria</i>—two rare and remote reptiles!” But, lawful
and necessary though this be, there must be stages on the path of
human evolution where such a method must fail and the anatomists
can do no more than hold aloof from theory or specula­tion, with a
certain grim enjoyment of the disputes and difficulties of the
genealogists.</p>


<h3>Initiative in Muscles.</h3>

<p>Initiative in the evolution of muscles clearly occurs somewhere
in the stem, and behind the formed expression of an altered habit
is the integrating action of the nervous system. This will be by
some looked at askance as a <i>deus ex machinâ</i> and reckoned as part
of the argument from ignorance in a way which recalls Weismann’s
scorn of Lamarckian factors in germinal selection. I submit that
what he and Osborn call “the unknown factor” of use and habit,
arising in response to new stimuli meets as no other proposed
sugges­tion does the formation of new muscles. Given a certain
fundamental architecture of skeleton and musculature, such as of
primitive vertebrates, one can, without doing violence to any
known facts, place the formation of new organs of movement in the
following <span class="nowrap">order:—</span></p>

<p class="ml2em">1. Neural changes and habits.</p>

<p class="ml2em">2. Muscular modifications.</p>

<p class="ti2em">3. Consequent modifications of bone. It carries the question
no further to say that these are correlated, however loose may be
the meaning of that word that is understood. If the prerogatives
of Selection within the germ, of segrega­tion of unit-characters
and dominance, and of mutations are not unlimited in the construc­tion
of organisms, there still remains a sphere of action for the
initiating power of the nervous system. Bones grow and change
their form in response to increased or altered muscular action on
them, and it is necessary to look back a stage further in the story to
the neural changes however produced. There have been abundant<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
opportunities in the long history of mammalian evolution for
primitive forms to take a new course of life, and they have done so
on an extensive scale. The impulses that have led them may have
been started by some “needs” such as Lamarck taught, some
change in their surroundings involving new stimuli, or “insults,”
as Haeckel called them, but the first of the structural stages must
have been in the cerebral cortex.</p>


<h3>Cross-Roads in Evolution.</h3>

<p>The most instructive levels of animal evolution are those where
two or more great stocks have diverged from a primitive one. There
may have been several factors leading to the division of the early
Ungulates into the odd-toed and even-toed groups, of the Carnivora
into cats, dogs and bears, the Felidæ into the highly-specialised
genera of that intense family, the early parting of gibbons from the
common anthropoid stem, and then the division of this line into
the three great genera with which we are familiar. Whatever may
have been the unknown factors in the environment such as changes
of climate and level, geographical isolation, increase of foes, profusion
or lack of food, to which these diverging stocks became
adapted in their organs and form, in fact whatever we do <i>not</i> know,
we know this—that in their measure they acquired more convoluted
and often larger brains, and the stimuli passing through their
receptors into their consciousness increased with an everflowing
tide, in volume, intensity and complexity. Many an archaic habit
of their race they must unlearn, and it is doubtful if germinal
selection would avail in this valuable process of economy as it is
held to do in the case of the human little toe.</p>

<p>It may be taken as granted that increasing complexity of
brain in their own lines of life did accompany these adventurers
of small or large groups. It follows that muscular changes from the
original stock would follow neural changes, for movement and
activity is inseparable from the animal, and the integrating action
of the nervous system would constantly initiate, maintain and
establish fresh habits and these be expressed in new muscular
structure. Whatever higher uses, as we believe them to be, man
makes of his brain, as reflec­tion, reasoning, imagina­tion and associa­tion,
such were not the new properties acquired by these adventurers.
They were very much concerned with hunger and love, and for them
“philosophy” did not sustain the structure of their world. But
more varied movements of head, trunk and limbs, and greater
agility and strength brought them such prizes as were within their
reach. This may be only another way of expressing Sir E. Ray<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
Lankester’s concep­tion of educability, which he maintains to be
the only acquired character the organism inherits, and it may be
therefore assumed to be under the iron law of selection. This must
be accepted with the respect due to the high authority from which
it proceeds. But such a concep­tion, while it removes a false light
in certain regions, sheds no light on the pathway of animal evolution,
unless modifications be transmitted, and we can now take it
that man does not inherit the power to speak which for incalculable
ages he has been learning, nor to write, even though in the days of
the early Pyramid-builders and the Sumerians in the plains of
Chaldea they possessed the power of writing, nor can a musician’s
child learn to play an instrument without teaching, or indeed man
perform any of his arts and crafts by second nature: so, negatively,
this knowledge is valuable, and the neo-Lamarckian must proceed
on his quest without anything more than educability to aid him—but
it will serve. The fact is that we do not inherit habits or associations
as such at all, but the neurones of the grey matter in spine
and brain which subserve, direct and control them. Though a
fresh neurone or two in the brain of an early ungulate deliberating,
so to speak, as to the life he shall take up, whether that of oxen
or horses, may be trifling in itself as to immediate value to the
animal, it may be to him as much a matter of fate to acquire those
microscopic cells as it was to the undifferentiated organism that
paused before it sealed its fate as plant. Under the free and
enlightened government of the integrating nervous system liberty
to express itself to an almost unlimited extent, in accordance with
progress, is thus open to the hypothetical adventurers.</p>

<p>When considering such an aspect of the organism as the
“choice” between the career of an odd-toed or even-toed ungulate,
a cat or dog, a lion or tiger, a gibbon or other of the four anthropoid
genera which assuredly was presented to certain groups of primitive
ungulates carnivores, felidæ or apes, as historical beings, the vision
of the process is sore let and hindered by the limiting force of certain
expressions which have been sanctioned with the <i>imprimatur</i> of
fifty years’ high thinking in the realms of high biology. I refer of
course to the terms Selection and Evolution which, though they
cannot be replaced by better terms, have the power and sometimes
have had the effect of impressing on the story of organic existence
an aspect of <i>determinism</i> which does not allow, for any purposive
action of the individual, the working out of its own salvation, on
the part of higher forms at any rate. As among nations self-expression
has become of late a powerful force in their development,
and indeed of individuals, so it may be argued by analogy that the<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
total experience of an organism, may result in its co-operation in
the process of its progress towards higher things. Bergson hints
at such a process in organisms, but appears to allow nothing for the
individual in his <i>élan vital</i>, where the mass alone counts. So if the
two binding terms of Selection and Evolution must be granted
their enormous power over our thoughts, there must be also a loosing
as well as a binding, and we, as well as certain young ecclesiastics in
a hurry, may put in a plea for Life and Liberty. Thus is Lamarckism
immortal, and the integrative action of the nervous system
supplies the reason.</p>

<p>This well-worn subject is not out of place here, where I am
trying to show evidence of self-expression in terms of muscular
modifica­tion arising from fresh activities of the brain.</p>


<h3>New Muscles.</h3>

<p>If it can be said without fear of question that “the differentia­tion
of muscle and nerve is the morphological result of division of
labour, whereby the unit of protoplasm, in which irritability and
contractility are combined, has, on the one hand, become modified
into muscle, which retains the property of contractility, and on the
other into nerve, which retains that of irritability,<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span> and if Wolff’s
<i>Law of Bone Transforma­tion</i> teaches that if a normal bone is used
in a new way its structure and form will change to meet its new
function, which Sir Charles Bell had more vaguely taught in 1834,
it cannot well be denied that at certain turning-points in the history
of animal organisms the sequence of changes which arise is neural
change, muscular modifica­tion and finally change of bone, whether
ungulates, carnivores, felidæ, gibbons or big anthropoids or man,
be the <i>dramatis personæ</i>. The only question is whether selection
or use and habit initiates the subtle and slow process.</p>


<h3>Unstriped Muscles.</h3>

<p>The simplest of the muscular acquirements of mammals is of
course that great mass of little structures which constitutes the
unstriped musculature. I must admit that here again I am engaged
with what the professed biologist may call trifles, but these, like
some others of a corresponding rank, have a provoking quality of
persistence, and display, if one may personify them, an insistent
desire to know whence they come and why they are here. Some of
these, like the one before us, may be comprehended in the great
chapter of the Evolution of the Indifferent of which they form a
page. This world, at any rate in the moral sphere, would be an<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
intolerable house of bondage if there were not many <i>things that
matter not</i> as well as <i>things that matter</i>, and there is reason to
believe that in the process of the making of man and a vast
number of forms below him there is a large field of structures,
parts and organs, where things that matter not are to be found.
One strange province of this realm is the coloura­tion of animals
in certain regions where no eye ever can see the colour or can take
any heed of the markings, treated very fully many years ago by
Mr. Beddard in <i>Animal Coloura­tion</i>.</p>

<p>Unstriped muscle arises, as the striped variety does, from the
mesoblastic muscle-plate and appears in nearly all organs, blood-vessels
and skin, and as trade is said to follow the flag, so a development
of new unstriped muscles must speedily be found in every new
structure of the regions where unstriped muscle is found. The
skin is the simplest, and less complicated by the presence of other
structures than vessels and organs, where it also exists, but where it
trespasses too much on the territory of selection for my immediate
purpose. A small band of this muscle called an <i>arrector</i>, or <i>erector</i>,
<i>pili</i> is attached to most, if not all, of the third of a million hairs
which cover the skin of man, and is inserted into that side of each
hair which forms an obtuse angle with the plane of the skin. This
tiny structure is endowed with the quality of contracting in response
to certain stimuli falling on the skin, so that it causes the hair to
which it is attached to stand erect instead of sloping, and incidentally
squeezes some of the secretion out of the sebaceous gland which
lies in each angle. The human skin thus possesses about a third
of a million minute muscular bands and shows no sign of parting
with this old gift from a lower hairy stock, and whatever value, if
any, their function be to their possessor they show a remarkable
readiness to perform it efficiently. It makes their existence and
persistence no clearer to call them vestigial, for one only thus
throws the question of their origin much farther back. Undoubtedly
they come from afar and were in full development in the earliest
hair-clad mammals, so an ancestry reaching back to Monotremes
or Marsupials is not to be lightly set aside. The raw material was
undoubtedly formed in response to stimuli conveyed to the brain,
and the earliest appearance of muscles which erected the hairs
must have been wholly insignificant either upon the survival or
comfort of the possessors.</p>


<h3>A Remarkable Example.</h3>

<p>The <i>arrectores pili</i> exhibit very little evidence of control or
interference from the action of the brain, but there is one region<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
of one animal, like the Rosetta stone that set Champollion at work,
where a very simple hieroglyph is recorded. I have been able to
find no other in all the hairy mammals I have examined than that
startling pattern which the back of the lion, shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_37">37</a>,
sometimes displays. That well-formed patch of reversed hair of
roughly triangular shape which is frequently found on the back of
a lion has been described and, as I interpret this strange structure,
it would seem clear that neural change in some examples of this
species has led to so persistent contrac­tion of the <i>arrectores pilorum</i>
over a certain area of skin, and that these have permanently reversed
the normal and primitive slope of the hair. I have never found it
present in a lioness, and not in all cases of male lions. It marks
its possessor with the brand of a fierce and especially savage
character, and he is not able to screen it from the eye of the Zoologist
as well as Milady did her brand of shame, until that fatal day
when D’Artagnan disclosed it. This pattern on a lion’s back is
strangely reminiscent of the ridge of bristling hair we see on the
corresponding region of a fierce dog’s back when he is infuriated.
In the latter it may be said to have selective value, as perhaps also
is the bristling hair on the head of a gorilla when enraged, much in
the same way as the Chinese warriors sought to alarm their enemies
by terrifying grimaces, or those terrifying tones and expressions of
face which the Tyrant man, really a coward, is said by such as
Miss Wisk to exercise over the women of his circle. We may present
all these to the Pan-Selectionist, but inasmuch as the short, bristling
hairs on the back of a lion are on the one hand hidden by the mane
from an animal in front, and on the other are so small as to be seen
quite close if at all, the survival-value of the reversed pattern of
hair in question is quite outside the province of selection. It is so
manifestly under the control of cerebral action, that it may be
compared, as an undesigned experiment, with that of man in
placing harness upon a horse, as to the power of cerebral action in
producing structure. Though, as far as I can learn, it stands alone,
it is difficult to believe that such a thing as a unique example occurs
in nature, but it is interesting and suggestive from the Lamarckian
point of view, and even the opposing counsel must admit that it is
among indifferent structures.</p>


<h3>Facial Muscles of Expression.</h3>

<p>This record in terms of hair of personal and ancestral emotions
has, however, a link with certain more numerous and important
striated muscles, such as the facial muscles of man and apes,
modifications of the great platysma-sheet, and which are disposed<span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
in two layers, a deep and a superficial. This covers like a hood at
the third month the head and neck of the embryo, and later assumes
on the face its specialised form of certain bands which operate
round the eyes and mouth. As they are of the striated kind these
muscles can be moved at will, but their main action is much more
under the government of the mental processes of their possessor.
As they are fundamentally the same in apes and man very little
new muscular structure arises in man, and little more than shaping
or refining takes place.</p>

<p>The facial muscles which operate round the orbit have less
mental action represented in them than those of the mouth, though
the action of the special elevator of the upper eyelid is conspicuous
among the expressions of a vigorous person. Both apes and man
have muscles on each side which raise or lower the angles of the
mouth, draw the angles upwards and outwards, and raise the upper
and depress the lower lip; and, though the muscle of the mouth
which corresponds to the <i>orbicularis</i> of the eye is not a continuous
structure, but formed of interrupted bundles of fibres, it is powerful
in closing the lips and active in the expressions. There are also in
man scattered oblique fibres in the substance of the lower lip,
well-developed and closely-set in a sucking child, and these in the
adult are scattered and less conspicuous.</p>

<p>There is thus a remarkable set of structures in the face of a
higher primate which convey mental emotion. As they also belong
to animals with a high degree of convolu­tion of brain, though
certain are found in lower mammals, their specialisa­tion is only to
be accounted for by the long-continued involuntary expression of
mental states existing in the particular form of primate. Professor
Keith says in the work before referred to: “Muscles supplied by the
facial nerve are the physical basis into which many mental states
are reflected, and in which they are realised. Through them mental
conditions are manifested. It is found that the differentia­tion
of this sheet into well-marked and separate muscles proceeds
<i>pari passu</i> with the development of the brain. The more
highly convoluted the brain of any primate the more highly
specialised are its facial muscles,<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> and he points out in a
smaller <span class="nowrap">work<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> that in the gibbon, and monkeys of the Old and
New Worlds the facial system becomes simpler and at the same
time more robust, and he pictures the facial muscles as the
“servants of the brain.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span></p>
<p>If an ape can express a good many of the coarser emotions of
an animal by the action of its facial muscles, and through kindness
and training exhibit some of the finer ones, there is a wide distance
between this level of attainment and the multiplied moods and
unnumbered varieties of expression which give to the human face
its unique charm. If we can express pleasure, pain, anger, contempt,
hatred, surprise, affection, sympathy, fear, hope, reflec­tion, perplexity,
gaiety, melancholy, cunning (and many another can be
supplied) what a remarkable field of physiology in terms of anatomy
we have in the facial muscles! There is a very obvious reason
why none of these emotions have been fixed in an objective form
in ape or man, as the patch of reversed hair is on the back of a lion,
for moods and states of feeling in every individual man are subject
to such endless variations that it would be impossible for them to
stamp any individual face with a record of even one emotion which
could be transmitted to descendants, to say nothing of the inconceivably
great probability that heredity would at once swamp
any initial modifica­tion.</p>


<h3>Three Stages.</h3>

<p>The stages then are but three—mental states, specialisa­tion
of small muscular bundles from an existing simple sheet of muscle,
and disuse of the remaining portions, and in this small but highly
significant field we see structures created independently of will as
servants of the brain, and without any survival-value in their
earliest stages. It is more than likely no monkey, ape, or early
man whose face was covered with thick hair from his eyes downwards,
ever saved his life or gained a better mate by reason of the
subtle modifica­tion of a tiny muscle which was proceeding <i>pari
passu</i> with the growing complexity of his convolutions and their
manifested emotions. This is not to claim that a more modern
man or woman would not find sexual selection of value by reason
of his or her more pleasing or commanding facial expression. That
the initiative of these alluring modifications was simple and
Lamarckian cannot be gainsaid, whatever the fruit of the finished
process may be to-day. We know in our own experience that
many a handsome person with good features and little expression
is often unsuccessful in the matrimonial market, when
another with defective features and a fine, delicate, attractive
expression takes the prize. So the early story of the formation
of muscles of expression is seen to be a page in the evolution of
the indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span></p>


<h3>The Fly-shaker Muscle.</h3>

<p>The panniculus carnosus, of which the facial muscles are part,
is a great system of musculature found in various animal forms, and
it furnishes a field for study of the evolution of the indifferent and
the initial stages of the formation of a muscle. This is a servant
of the brain in a more indirect manner than the facial muscles,
but it, too, arises in obedience to the integrative action of the brain.
The early specialisa­tion of it need not be considered here. It may
be considered unwarrantable to claim the great Fly-shaker muscle
of Ungulates as an indifferent structure, but the arguments by
which the Pan-Selectionist would annex it to his sceptre, as a
triumph of the minute care of the organism by selection, rest only
on the assump­tion that he knows how it has become an adapta­tion
to the life of its possessors. This is now more than it used to be a
matter of opinion since the publica­tion of Professor Bateson’s
revolutionary <i>Materials</i>, and others beside he have reserved to
themselves the liberty of doubting the accepted explanations by
the tangled path of adapta­tion. The statement of Weismann,
“Everything is adapted in animated nature” was necessary to
his theory of germinal selection, but it admits of extensive and
numerous exceptions in view of the fact that so much of adapta­tion
is partial and imperfect. If he had said that <i>every organism</i> as a
being is adapted he would have been nearer the truth, but that
every tissue and part of an organism is adapted is demonstrably
untrue. A large number of organisms, themselves apparently
well adapted, flourish well enough and reproduce their kind in
spite of faulty and rudimentary tissues and parts. If it were not
so we should have seen little of progress except what come under
the laws of genetics,—a distributional matter. Even the super-Geddes
could not distribute what was not there, for he could not
deal with raw materials and change them by a fairy wand into
manufactured articles. In the great field of domesticated plants
and animals man has to find not only some mutation or some
dominant strain and breed it to his will, but to cultivate the domestic
qualities of animals and employ cultural conditions for plants.
There is doubt expressed as to the length of time or numbers of
generations during which these cultural conditions can extend, but
Professor Thiselton Dyer many years ago made the remarkable
statement as to plants:—“While specific stability under constant
conditions appears to be the rule in nature, it is widely different
in cultiva­tion. When a plant is brought under cultural conditions
it maintains its type for some time unaltered, then gives way
and becomes practically plastic. From my experience at Kew,<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
where I saw the process continually going on, I hazarded the
generalisa­tion that any species, annually reproduced from seed,
could be broken down in five years. During that period specific
stability, though menaced, tends to maintain itself. Darwin
was well aware of this.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span></p>

<p>Most biologists from time to time betray the fact that their
minds can only be relieved from an intolerable burden, in accounting
for the numberless adaptations in organisms, by the view that
many of them originate through factors of use and stimuli from
environment, and at first are entirely indifferent as regards the
survival or better mating of their possessors. To which the stern
opponent replies, “What is there to show that in the existing scheme
of things there is any provision made which will minister relief to
the burden of your little mind?” To which, “answer came there
none,” except a subdued reflec­tion that everything we see of living,
striving nature around us has a most provoking way of speaking to
us of daily, hourly and incessant action and reaction, stimulus
and response, and that those who view the process thus do seem
to bring some order into what would otherwise be chaos—and
yet all the while someone is being grossly deceived! This “may
be magnificent but it is not proof,” some will say, and will ask if
the older observers of the heavenly bodies were not wrong in their
complete convic­tion that the sun went round the earth. This
digression introduces the role of the fly-shaker. If I am told
that this muscular sheet in a cow or horse to-day is a relic of raw
material inherited from a remote ungulate stock little evolved,
and that it contributes in hot weather in the time of flies to the
comfort and better mental state of the cow or horse, that it shall
be able to keep those enemies at bay, and that the muscle is kept
well in order by two or three months’ practice in each year I can
understand in a measure its presence to-day. It has an efficient
ally in the sweeping tail of a cow and that of a wild horse, and both
of these weapons are further aided by the mobile ears of cow and
horse, and the stretching movements of its head and neck. Thus
the body of a cow, for example, is like a map with four territories
delimited, that of the fly-shaker, the tail, the ears and the head and
neck. Between these offensive weapons a cow is better defended
against flies than a European in India by his punkah, or China
was by its great wall, or Britain by the wall of <i>Vallum</i> of Hadrian
or the wall of Severus, which with forts and garrisons was designed
to protect it. Speaking in allegory the evolving brain of an early<span class="pagenum" title="212"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
ungulate occupies the position of an ancient Chinese Emperor or a
Roman Proconsul in Britain in its provision against “barbarians,”
either Asiatic or Celtic. The resemblance goes further, for no
experienced Roman General, whatever the Celestial minds in
China may have thought, would fear that the loss of a sector of
his wall would imperil the army of occupa­tion in Britain or the
fabric of the Roman Empire. But as, in the long run it contributes
to one’s welfare to be comfortable, and even the domestic ungulate
is somewhat of a hedonist, a well-developed fly-shaker is maintained,
the occasional use of which in winter and frequent use in summer
and the active purposeful switching of tail, twitching of ears and
jerking of head have their limited value. Here there is ample
room for diverse opinion and the opponent will ask with some degree
of force how we know that there is no more benefit to the cow from
its fly-shaker than a mild degree of comfort, and may assert that
the possession and use of it may have survival-value by its defence
against deadly parasites. We do not know, nor does he, but it
would seem that except for the tsetse fly in Africa the plague of
flies does little to an ungulate beyond irritating its brain, and if
he had no fly-shaker, he would still be able to reach a considerable
distance with his tail, ears and head over the irritated regions.
The question of survival indeed resolves itself into the vigour and
energy of his integrating brain.</p>

<p>To this view of the function and origin of the panniculus
carnosus the busy systematist and student of genetics may refuse
to listen, and pass to the order of the day, but I submit that in
stating a position it is useful to put forward a crude example in
which the issue is plain, and which subsumes an immense number
of smaller and more subtle cases, and in a region where the most
hardy rebel will not dispute altogether the sway of <i>personal</i> selection.
It is a question here of the manner in which, speaking in metaphor,
the early ungulate first set about making his eolithic or palæolithic
weapons and fashioned them into what we see to-day. “Forged
by the incident of use” and habit meets the story of the fly-shaker
far better than some mutation arising in far back ages or some
dominant variation, or “useful variation within the germ.” At
any rate Lamarck finds the raw material to hand, and there are
supplied adequate noci-cipient stimuli with response, in regions
where these are most active under the dominating action of the
brain.</p>


<h3>Other Muscles.</h3>

<p>In the skeletal muscles of the primates many muscles offer
themselves for considera­tion as examples of inherited structures<span class="pagenum" title="213"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
arising under the stimuli of altered function, and only a few of
these will be dealt with. It might appear sufficient to those who
yield, perhaps too willingly, to authority, if I were here to try and
prove my point by quoting the statements of one of the greatest
anatomists of our time and country, and so pass on—but it is to be
feared authority cannot carry one far in a dispute so important.
Macalister says, however, “The anatomical arrangement of the
muscular system is the physical exponent of habitual actions and
those actions are the chief factors in moulding the bones and in
regulating the position of the somato-pleural vessels and nerves”—and
“the locomotory function and consequent utility of the trunk-muscles
were lost when the early vertebrates became terrestrial.
In higher vertebrates, and notably in man, the mobility of several
regions of the vertebral column differs both in degree and kind:
the outgrowing vertebrate processes show consequent variations,
and <i>the muscular system is varied accordingly</i>.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> Also “as both
origins and insertions (of muscles) are the creatures of habit, they
are both equally variable with variation of function; but, as in
higher animals the kind of work to be done is more constant than
its degree, so, as a rule, insertions alter less than origins.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span>
Macalister, at any rate, held a very clear dynamical rather than
static view of the making of the muscular system. But as the
days of authority are in a certain sense gone for ever, and we live
under the reign of experiment, research and questioning, every
biologist, within certain limits, does what is right in his own eyes;
there is no King in these days.</p>

<p>Skeletal muscles are structures in which, if ever, the factors
of use and habit and disuse would be shown, because muscle is a
tissue, with highly active metabolism, so that it has been called
“an expensive tissue” for the animal to maintain.</p>


<h3>Muscles of Primates.</h3>

<p>This physiological fact agrees with the anatomical results of
an extended study in the musculature of primates, especially of
man, and Hartmann’s book on Anthropoid Apes supplies abundant
evidence of the variations of the muscles of these animals, which
are not at all more striking than their differing modes of life would
suggest. It would be wearisome to quote all these, but a single
muscle may be given as an example of a special ape’s muscle with
variable distribu­tion. It is called <i>latissimo-condyloideus</i> and starts
from the insertion of the <i>latissimus dorsi</i> and passes along the inner<span class="pagenum" title="214"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
aspect of the humerus for a variable distance. In the <i>baboon</i> and
others it goes to be inserted into the inner inter-muscular septum
and the internal condyle of the humerus, in the <i>orang</i> to the condyle,
and in the <i>gibbon</i> to the centre of the shaft. As to origin it
proceeds from the insertion of the <i>latissimus dorsi</i>, but in the <i>gorilla</i>
from the coracoid process of the scapula and from two portions of
the <i>pectoralis minor</i>, and is finally attached to the inter-muscular
septum between the <i>brachialis anticus</i> and the <i>triceps</i>; in the
<i>chimpanzee</i> it divides into an anterior and posterior portion, the
former being attached to the inner condyle, the latter to the
middle and inner head of the <i>triceps</i>; in the <i>orang</i> it divides
similarly, but in one particular example it had an anterior
thin portion attached by a slender tendon to the coracoid
process of the scapula and a posterior portion arose from the
<i>latissimus dorsi</i>; in the <i>white-handed gibbon</i> it arose from the
function of tendons from the <i>latissimus dorsi</i> and <i>teres major</i>
and was inserted into the fascia between the tendon of the <i>biceps</i>
and the <i>brachialis anticus</i>.</p>

<p>Such a divergence as this within the strict limits of an
anthropoid muscle, concerned in the various forms of climbing
action of these apes, can only suggest an origin from a
divergent set of functions and small details in their respective
modes of climbing.</p>


<h3>Hand and Foot of Man.</h3>

<p>Both the hand and foot of man supply a small muscle for
considera­tion in the present connec­tion of habit with formation of
new structure. If man be regarded as of simian origin there are
not as many entirely new muscles in his equipment as would be
expected from his departure from the habits of simian ancestors,
though many muscles are found to be altered in size and shifted
from the ancestral positions. But the human hand presents one
suggestive example of a little muscle not found in any other animal,
the special small extensor of the thumb, arising from the interosseous
membrane between the radius and ulna, and from the radius, being
segmented off from the <i>extensor of the metacarpal of the thumb</i>, and
it accompanies this muscle and tendon to be inserted into the first
phalanx of the thumb, and is peculiar to man. It can be easily
seen at the radial border of the well-known “snuff-box” which
is produced by it when it is fully extended. This is of course a
muscle of small importance to the functions of the hand, and its
appearance in man can only be supposed to be a subordinate detail
easily derived from the <i>greater extensor</i> by reason of the more<span class="pagenum" title="215"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
delicate adjustment to complicated movements of the hand under
the directing power of higher cerebral development.</p>


<h3>Peroneus Tertius.</h3>

<p>The foot of man possesses the small <i>peroneus tertius</i> which was
referred to as one of the evertors of the foot concerned in the construc­tion
of his plantar arch. Macalister and Professor Keith both
speak of it as peculiar to man, and the latter refers to it at some
length<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> the whole passage being worth quoting here. “Although
the evolution of the human method of progression was attended
by a profound altera­tion in the form and action of every muscle
and bone with lower limbs, yet this great transforma­tion was
produced without the appearance of any really new element. One
new muscle—the <i>peroneus tertius</i>—did appear, and the history of
its evolution throws an interesting sidelight on the origin of new
structures. It arises by the outer fibres of the common extensor
muscles of the toes being separated. In all the anthropoids the
feet are so articulated at the ankle-joints that the soles are directed
towards each other, and only the outer edge of the foot comes to
rest on the ground when the animal tries to stand. The feet have a
tendency to assume a similar position in children at birth. The
advantage of a muscle, such as the <i>peroneus tertius</i>, is apparent
in the human foot, for it tends to raise the outer border of the foot,
so that the sole is properly applied to the ground. If we examine
the muscles which, rising from the front of the leg, cross the ankle-joint
to end on the back of the foot on the toes of fifty men, we shall
find every stage in the evolution of this muscle. In one man at
least it will be undeveloped; in two or perhaps three it will be
represented by a part of the tendon of the extensor muscle of the
little toe, which in place of ending entirely on the toe sends a part
to end on the metatarsal bone of the little toe. In only forty of
the fifty men will the <i>peroneus tertius</i> be found quite isolated from
the parent muscle—<i>the extensor communis digitorum</i>, and to have
a distinct origin from the fibula in the leg, and a separate
insertion to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone in the foot.
In a series of fifty specimens every stage in the isolation of
this new muscle will be seen. It has never been found in
any anthropoid, and is more often absent or undeveloped in
African than European races.”</p>

<p>To this excellent account I have only to add one comment.
It can hardly be an accident or without significance that this special<span class="pagenum" title="216"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
human evertor of the foot concerned in the construc­tion of the
plantar arch is “often absent or undeveloped” in African races,
which are well-known in some groups to have adapted themselves
to a form of foot which shows no plantar arch, being normally
flat-footed. In this small field of observa­tion, a mere plot of
lentils like that which Shammah defended of old, there is set forth
a mimic battlefield, and it is not difficult to see that the forces at
work can owe allegiance to one and one only of various commanders.
The problem as to the origin of the <i>peroneus tertius</i> would no more
attract the Mendelian than did the trousseau and approaching
marriage of Caddie Jellyby attract the far-away gaze of her mother,
fixed upon the world of Borria-boula-gha, and, for that matter,
de Vries would hardly pay it more attention—to him it would be
indifferent; whereas Weismann would have as much to say about
it as about the little toe of man, which furnished for him and Herbert
Spencer such fruitful material for debate many years ago. This
muscle resembles the results of some of Michael Angelo’s first
attempts at sculpture, thrown aside perhaps in his place of work
and from time to time taken up, rough-hewn again and again and
finally shaped into a form far from perfect, but with the value and
teaching of a failure for him who was some day to outshine all
modern rivals. If the history of this muscle be not one of initiative
in evolution through the factor of use and habit the Pan-Selectionist
must do the best he can with an incalculable number of “trials
and errors,” and must suppose that, rather than allow this small
territory to the neo-Lamarckian, a long series of man’s ancestors
have been making experiments for the benefit of man’s walking
power under the guidance of selection with an insignificant muscle
whose only function is that of aiding in the eversion of the foot,
and that in the rudimentary condition described by Professor Keith
it had selective value. No one who was not committed to a dominating
theory could hesitate for a moment which of the two alternative
views of the origin of the <i>peroneus tertius</i> he would choose.
Dr. Barclay Smith speaks in the paper referred to above of the
<i>extensor brevis pollicis</i>, or <i>minor</i>, as a muscle of extremely late
appearance, and as “peculiarly human,” and says all the evidence
points to its being a segmenta­tion product of the <i>extensor ossis
metacarpi pollicis</i>, its appearance being foreshadowed in the anthropoid
by an extension of that muscle on to the proximal phalanx
of the thumb.</p>

<p>It is not without interest to the thesis before us to read the
rather bewildering story of the early life of a very insignificant
muscle such as the small extensor of the thumb of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="217"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span></p>

<p>As illustrations of the moulding and pruning of perfected
muscles it may be remembered that, as Macalister says, “portions
of muscles may also become detached and degenerated so as to
act as ligaments,” and “the adult muscular system of man bears
everywhere traces of earlier cleavings and subsequent fusions,
partial disappearances and local outgrowths.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> This passage
recalls one in which Huxley says in watching certain phases of
development you can almost see the hidden artist at work, and
here the sculptor may be pictured in his chipping, trimming,
rejecting and finally shaping, some creation of his brain; and from
a biological point of view a vision of the processes of use and disuse
may be obtained. Professor Keith also speaks often of the migrations
of muscular attachments in a way which agrees with the
passage quoted from Macalister.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

INNERVATION OF THE HUMAN SKIN.</h2>


<p>For at least seventy years the surface of the human skin has been
the subject of so much physiological observa­tion and experiment
that Professor Sherrington considers the literature connected with
it to be probably greater than in any other branch of physiology.
Most of this study centres round the skin as a receptive field and
problems of the nervous system. It is easy to see why this should
be in the case of an organ so great as the skin, covering all the other
structures and organs and exposed through ages of evolution to the
vicissitudes of an inconceivable number of stimuli. And one
outcome of this study is to show that, metaphorically speaking,
the skin is a mosaic, and not the confused and blurred produc­tion
of a child of four years old who has been given a sheet of paper and
a paint-box. There is order in this field, and even without calling
in final causes, plan and purpose. Beside the protective function
exercised by the skin it plays a large part, through its nervous
endowment, in the processes by which the brain is made aware of
the surrounding phenomena, thus conveying intelligence to the
centre of life only less important than that of the special senses.
It is maintained here that the result of the various physical stimuli,
of which pain, cold, warmth and touch are the chief, is that certain
functions and structures of the skin have arisen in response to them.</p>

<p>This is, no doubt, to beg the question of origin, and if the
balance of evidence be seen to be against this view the order of
events would need to be stated differently. But the position is
clear, whether correct or not, and if it be shown to be erroneous
it will at least have good “lighthouse value.”</p>


<h3>Observed Facts.</h3>

<p>Briefly stated the facts of the innerva­tion of the skin are of
two orders, anatomical and physiological; the former examined
by the aid of the microscope, the latter by physiological experiments
of a varied kind. The chief aspect in which these are viewed here
is the mode of distribution of these two groups of fact, and it is
held that this strongly suggests without proving it, the alleged
mode of origin of both.</p>

also one thread of origin running through all, and that is that the
regions most exposed to the four stimuli show the highest development
of specialised function and structure.</p>

<h3>Some Aspects of the Nervous System.</h3>

<p>It has been said with some truth that the telephone has struck
a mortal blow at such serenity of life as the Juggernaut Car of
modern progress has left us. But if it has done nothing else it has
furnished the physiologist with a good illustra­tion when he sets
out to expound the functions and arrangement of the elements
of the central nervous system and its peripheral expansion. In
addition to this general light upon a great matter the vivid
experience of many an Englishman during the recent years of war
adds point to a subordinate phase of the general story of the telephone,
for it represents my conten­tion as to the origin or initiative
of the sensorial areas of the mosaic under considera­tion. Modern
persons may be divided into two classes, those who want and those
who do not want the telephone, and the former may be sub-divided
into A, those who can, and B those who cannot get it (or could not).
A and B from the present point of view may be termed Receptors,
though to call the B people by that name is to speak Hibernically.
With this war-time experience in our minds, we may picture a vast
period of time during which the stimuli of pain, cold, warmth and
touch were hammering on the skin both before it began to lose its
chief hairy covering, and after that process had left man still a
hairy animal, but with much-diminished amount of his ancient
heritage. These stimuli fell upon the skin very much as the
class A, among telephone receptors, spent numerous fruitless
stimuli on Postmasters-General, Ministers in Parliament and in
“short” bitter letters to our bright little <i>Daily Pope</i>, and who yet
found themselves not “connected up,” as the saying goes. There
is no knowing how long it was before they had enough effect
on the delicate nerve fibrils struggling up into the epidermis and
produced receptors or were “connected up” to the exchange or
central nervous system. I am inclined to liken the pain stimuli
to the short letters referred to, the cold and warmth stimuli to
those addressed to the Postmasters-General and the touch stimuli
to those which fell upon Ministers at question time.</p>

<p>Another comparison of the peripheral portion of the nervous
system to common things has at times forced itself upon my mind
when reflecting on the stimuli which are continually assaulting the
skin, as I have watched on the Needles’ Downs a flock of sheep on a
summer evening returning to their fold. As the sun begins to set
they are scattered over the western end of the Downs, still cropping
the short grass clothing those chalk and flint slopes which from
immemorial time has alone flourished there. They wander singly
or in small groups on such parts of the slope as the intrusive golfer<span class="pagenum" title="224"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
still allows, and gradually fall into larger groups which follow
somewhat indefinite paths. As they move further and further
towards home they are seen to follow one another in single file on
some score or more of clearer paths, and finally converge into one
well-beaten and broad path until they descend the northern slope
and pass out by a single roadway into which a gate opens, and so
reach the haven where they would be. Here one has a simple
picture of the common stimuli of the skin, at first indefinite and
ineffectual, by their cumulative action producing an individual
receptor and its nerve connec­tion with the central system.</p>

<p>Professor Leonard <span class="nowrap">Hill<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span> also gives a view of the general action
of the nervous system and compares it to control of the police force.
He supposes a murder to have been committed in a village, and
that the local policeman telegraphs to the local town ordering the
roads to be searched. The policeman is the tactile sense-organ,
the telegraph wire is the sensory nerve, the telegraph office in the
local town is the spinal cord, from this office a message is sent to
the town police-station by another wire and the police are set in
motion. The police are the muscles, the wire that sets them in
motion in the motor nerve. The message is also sent to neighbouring
towns and to London, that is to say, other local offices (parts of the
spinal cord) and the head office (the brain) are informed of the
crime or sensory impulse. The central office in London directs
the operations controlling the local police office. The whole order
of events need not be here described because it goes beyond my
immediate purpose, but it is enough to say that attached to the
head office are the cleverest detectives (higher sense-organs) and
in these are kept records of past crimes, lines of action of the police,
and success or non-success of their investigations.</p>

<p>Following on this picture he speaks of the way in which conscious
actions become automatic and makes a statement to the
effect that “<i>There is evidence to show that the axons</i> (or processes
of the nerve-cells which extend unbroken from nerve-cell to its
termina­tion) <i>become covered with a adulated coat as each new tract
is formed. Thus the structure, like the habit, becomes fixed</i>”—and—“<i>It
would appear as if, by repeated experiences, tracts and pathways
must be beaten through the nervous system</i><span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> (Italics not in original).</p>

<p>Beside this I place a statement from Professor Graham Kerr
as to his view of the development of peripheral nerve-trunks. He
is reviewing the “outgrowth” theory of His, the “chain cell”
theory of Balfour, and the “Primitive Continuity” theory of<span class="pagenum" title="225"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
Hensen, and expresses himself as follows: “<i>It is suggested that the
development of the actual nerve fibril is simply the coming into view
of a pathway produced by the repeated passage of nerve impulses
over a given route.</i><span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> (Italics not in original.)</p>

<p>A passage from Professor McDougall’s <i>Physiological Psychology</i>
may also be referred to at more length than it was in Chapter III.,
page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_25">25</a>. Speaking of the automatiza­tion of voluntarily acquired
actions which have been explained by the view that purely reflex
actions carried out by mechanisms of the spinal level were also
originally acquired by our original ancestors as voluntary actions,
he says, “This view is usually associated with the name of Wundt,
who has forcibly advocated it. It implies, of course, the assump­tion
that acquired characters are in some degree transmitted from one
genera­tion to another, a proposi­tion which most biologists at
the present time are inclined to deny because they cannot conceive
how such transmissions can be effected. Nevertheless, the rejection
of this view leaves us with insuperable difficulties when we attempt
to account for the evolution of the nervous system, and there are no
established facts with which it is incompatible. If, therefore, we
accept this view we shall regard the congenital neural dispositions,
both those that determine pure reflexes and those that determine
instinctive actions, as having been acquired and consolidated under
the guidance of individual experience, with the co-operation, to
a degree which we cannot determine, of natural selection.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span></p>

<p>These three statements from a physiologist, a zoologist, and
a psychologist, all of great eminence, though they differ in particular
problems studied, tell very strongly in favour of the position here
put forward as to initiative in the produc­tion of specialised
innerva­tion of the skin.</p>


<h3>Origin of Cold, Warm, Pain and Touch Spots.</h3>

<p>The hair-clad skin of primitive man provided ample raw
material for the eventual differentia­tion of both end-organs and
sensorial areas which is found to-day. Not only did he possess
what is called Common Sensation in his skin but in the individual
hairs lay a delicate tactile structure, which, though probably
inferior in delicacy, serves a similar purpose to that of the vibrissæ
on the muzzle of Felidæ. Each hair, being deeply inserted into
the skin and supplied with fine nerve fibrils, when it is bent, acts
as a lever communicating an impulse to an afferent nerve trunk.<span class="pagenum" title="226"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
In an animal covered with thick hair the sensory impulse conveyed
might be exceedingly delicate, but, from the nature of the case,
of much more limited range than in one like man in whom the hair
is so greatly diminished in length and thickness.</p>

<p>It would be fruitless to speculate as to which of these four
forms of stimuli was the earliest to become effective in
developing man.</p>


<h3>Cold and Pain.</h3>

<p>Two of them, cold and pain, may be termed <i>nocuous</i>; one,
that of touch, <i>useful</i>, and one, that of warmth, <i>indifferent</i>. If it be
true, as Professor Scott Elliott states<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> that man’s earliest home had
a climate which “lies between the regular tropical, with wet,
steaming, impassable jungles, and the colder temperate zone, so
affording chance of acclimatisa­tion in both directions,” the stimuli
of cold would even then not be wanting, however much they
increased in severity when he passed through glacial periods; but
wherever, whenever, and at whatever time he first became man
he had to tread the Via Dolorosa in the course of his hard and eventful
life, and must have been well accustomed in all regions of his
skin to the stimuli of pain, working, as he did, for his living, and
fighting for it and his mate, with varied and powerful enemies.
Though it is correct to call both these fundamental stimuli
“nocuous,” this is all a matter of degree, and both the stimulus of
moderate cold, raising blood-pressure and activating metabolism,
and that of minor pains, would do little else than good in his
education for the higher terrestrial life to which he had descended.
If he was to learn effectually to take care of himself the discipline
of both moderate cold and pain would be as valuable to him then as
in its measure it is to his descendant to-day. The triumphs of
medicine and surgery could never have appeared if it were not for
the beneficent warning voice of pain that so generally accompanies
disease.</p>

<p>Through long ages of exposure to the stimuli of cold and pain
came response in the form of cold and pain spots, after minute
struggles between the static conservative tissues of the skin and the
dynamic force of repeated assaults upon them. In due time then
receptors appeared and each became connected with the central
organs, by which means better adapted motor reactions against
“nocuous” cold and pain became possible. In 1900 Professor
Sherrington summed up the evidence in Schafer’s work on Physiology
against the existence <span class="pagenum" title="227"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>“of separate afferent fibres with their specific
end-organs entrusted specifically with carrying painful impressions
to a pain centre,” but Professor Starling in his later work on Human
Physiology speaks of “a distinct sense of pain,” probably subserved
by a distinct set of nerve fibres, but for the present purpose it is not
necessary that agreement on such a problem should be reached, for
it is alone with pain <i>spots</i> that we are concerned. He also points
out that on the one hand the cornea is sensitive to only one of
the four stimuli in question, that is, pain, and on the other
that the surface of the glans penis is sensitive to cold and
pain, but tactile sensation and warmth sensations are almost
entirely absent.</p>

<p><i>Touch.</i>—This form of stimulus and its response can only be
reckoned as useful to the organism, except that it may be, and often
must be indifferent. The great number of the touch spots can be
understood when it is declared by Professor Sherrington that
almost invariably there are one or more touch spots close to the
emergence of each hair<span class="nowrap">,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> and that they are very numerous also
on the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hand and foot. Of the
four forms of cutaneous stimuli those of touch are the only kind
that have so far been proved to have specialised corpuscles, the
other three having developed the physiological equivalent of cold,
pain and warmth <i>spots</i>.</p>

<p><i>Warmth spots</i> are decidedly the least numerous of the four,
those of pain being, as stated by Professor Sherrington, the most
numerous. It is obvious that unless thermal stimuli become
somewhat excessive they hardly can be described as “stimuli,”
being more or less neutral in their action on a warm-blooded animal.
This cannot be entirely so, because it has been shown quite conclusively
that warmth spots <i>do</i> exist, though much less numerous
than others. There is a significant fact as to thermal reaction
and that is that there are no pure <i>heat</i> spots like those of cold, for
the stimuli of about 49°&nbsp;C are so associated with those of pain
that warmth spots alone are distinguished, and among primitive
man no stimuli of heat could impinge on his skin, until he had
learned the use of fire, more powerful than those of solar heat.</p>

<p>Such stimuli of heat as the rays of the sun would occasionally
discharge on the skin would resolve themselves into the general
stimulus of pain, and in this direction a far shorter initia­tion
occurred than with any of the four normal cutaneous stimuli. The
fact, at any rate, of there being no <i>heat</i> spots is to be noted.</p>

<p>It remains now, having quoted three writers eminent in
physiology, psychology and zoology in support of the modest<span class="pagenum" title="228"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
thesis here put forward for me to appeal to the authority of the
facts contained in the tables for such evidence as they can give,
and to give a summary of this.</p>


<h3>Summary.</h3>

<p>1. Table I. shows that the structures known as touch corpuscles
are distributed on those parts of the skin where the stimuli of touch
fall most and in propor­tion to the degree in which those parts are
employed in tactile discrimina­tion; thus, most of all on the index
finger (with the exception of the tip of the tongue) next on the
thumb and less on the middle finger. There are 530 of these
corpuscles to the upper and 317 to the lower extremity.</p>

<p>2. Table II. bears out the same conclusion, the average number
of corpuscles to a square millimetre being twenty-one on the
terminal, eight on the second and four on the first phalanges of the
index finger, whereas on the foot there are seven on the great
toe much exposed to stimuli and only two on the middle of the
sole of the foot, which is little exposed. The absence of them
from the cornea and conjunctiva, protected by quick and powerful
reflexes from such stimuli, and from the (normally) covered glans
penis is in accordance with the other results.</p>

<p>3. Table III. dealing with touch spots, shows that these are
nearly twice as numerous on the flexor as the dorsal surface of the
forearm; and nearly five times as numerous as on the scalp, where
tactile stimuli are few, and that the distal phalanx of a finger
contains about seven times as many as an area between the
shoulders. The regions poor in touch spots are shown to be those
where relatively few tactile stimuli can fall.</p>

<p>4. Table IV. gives cold and warmth sensations graded according
to the delicacy with which they are perceived in many regions of
the skin. The cold sensations are best distinguished on the parts
normally most exposed to cold, as the tips of fingers, malleoli,
tip of nose, chin, patella, wrist, and least on the protected areas,
inner side of thigh, flank, loins and abdomen. The warmth sensations
are best distinguished on the regions on which the stimuli of warmth
has most frequently fallen, tips of fingers and toes, cavity of mouth,
palm of hand, less so on the neck and loin. And the striking fact
is noted that warmth sensations are not felt in the lower gums,
the inside of the cheek at a certain level and the cornea, which
again is protected from these stimuli by its efficient reflex, whereas
to the gums and inside of the cheek most warmth stimuli have
not been “stimuli” at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="229"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span></p>

<p>5. Table V. also gives results of the mode of distribu­tion of
cold and warmth spots, examined with punctiform stimuli. The
“local sign” for cold is higher than that for warmth spots, and
two of these are distinguished as double when only 0.8 millimetres
apart on the palm, cheek, chin and forehead, whereas on the
upper arm, back and thigh, they are only distinguished as double
when separated by two millimetres, and this distance is the minimum
at which warmth spots are distinguished as two, that is 2&nbsp;mm. on
the palm, and five on cheek, chin, forehead and back. This tells
the same story as Table IV., of past stimuli of cold and warmth.</p>

<p>6. Table VI. deals more elaborately than the others with double
sensation in different areas of the skin, the tip of the tongue being
the most accurate in this respect of all examined, and the tip of the
index finger next, which is to the great toe as 2.3 to 11.3, the palmar
surface of a finger half as accurate again as the dorsal surface,
the palm of the hand twice as accurate as the surfaces of the forehead
and back of ankle, nearly four times as much so as the dorsum
of the foot and six times as the skin of the middle of the back.</p>

<p>There is here a very close relation between the amount of
exposure of these various regions to tactile stimuli and their present
equipment of ability to discriminate between two small objects.</p>

<p>7. Table VII. deals with the sensation of pressure in certain
groups of areas, and shows that change of pressure is perceived
about three or four times as accurately on the forehead, lips and
tongue, as on the finger nail, back of forearm, hand, or fingers,
and more than three or four times on the back of the foot, and sole,
and surface of leg and thigh. In this group of observations also
the rule is followed that the greater and more frequent in man’s
ancestral past have been the exposure of his skin to variations of
pressure, the greater is his present power of accurate discrimina­tion
of them.</p>

<p>There are some scattered facts mentioned by Professor
Sherrington which are in keeping with the line here taken,
that the formation of receptors in the skin have their origin in
accumulated stimuli. He refers to the vain endeavours of Goltz to
evoke the reflex croak of the female frog by applying electrical
stimuli to the skin, whereas non-nocuous mechanical stimuli were
the only stimuli that proved effective.</p>

<p>He never was able to elicit the “extensor thrust” in the
“spinal dog” by any form of <i>electrical</i> stimula­tion, but only by a
particular kind of mechanical stimulus. This peculiarity was
also found in the pinna reflex of the cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="230"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span></p>

<p>As to the scratch reflex in the dog it was only when it was
<i>easily elicitable</i> that it could be evoked by electrical stimula­tion as
well as mechanical, and when it was not easily elicitable electrical
stimuli failed altogether while mechanical stimuli still evoked it.</p>

<p>He describes the receptor as a mechanism “<i>attuned</i> to respond
specially to a certain one or ones of the agencies that act as
stimuli to the body,” and points to the fact that <i>electrical</i> stimuli
are not of common occurrence in nature and no chance for adapta­tion
to evolve in the organism receptors appropriate for such stimuli
has been afforded. Such negative facts are at the least suggestive
in considering the question of the mode of origin of receptors and
end-organs, electrical stimuli being rare in nature.</p>

<p>The subject of the innerva­tion of the skin and its receptors
has been treated here in a great measure by the aid of imagina­tion,
with some evidence, and a good deal of reconstruc­tion has been
attempted, but perhaps this will be pardoned by those who are
prepared to carry out a corresponding process with such as Pithecanthropus,
Eoanthropus and Saurian monsters from somewhat
scanty osseous remains. Any biological theory of the origin of
these receptors than the one here put forward is faced with some
formidable difficulties, which are probably insurmountable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

THE BUILDING OF REFLEX ARCS.</h2>


<p>Assuming the foregoing origin of the innerva­tion of the skin, I
submit that between this rudimentary process and the building
of sensori-motor arcs in the spinal cord and brain there is a field,
almost unlimited, for initiative in the construc­tion of new forms
of animal life. The former is nothing without the latter. To leave
it without proceeding further is to leave it “in the air” as military
writers say. The formation of Receptors, then, both in the skin
field and in the higher sense-organs, leads of necessity to the formation,
multiplica­tion and co-ordina­tion of reflex arcs. As in an
imperfectly organised telephone service after many a repeated
stimuli or “rings” the messages begin to reach their destinations,
and as by practice the operators better and better learn their
business, so the impulses passing through receptors and nerve-fibrils
become organized into more or less efficient systems of arcs,
and response is secured to them by some effector of gland or muscle.
It is not true of man alone that practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>A certain feature of higher animals which distinguishes them
from lower must be remembered, and that is that among them the
individual becomes increasingly important. Speaking generally,
the latter are born and die in large groups, and their lives resemble
those of their group more closely than in the former. The struggle
of the individual is vividly pictured by Professor Woods Jones in
his descrip­tion of the baby of the perfected arboreal animals. He
shows how they and the roaming Ungulates and Pelagic Cetacea
cannot indulge in large families, and that it is only those forms which
have a safe retreat for their young which can avoid reduction of the
size of their families, and how the higher apes still more resemble
in these respects mankind, as we know it. For the proper study
of the “synthesis of the individual” organism this essential fact
must be kept in mind.</p>


<h3>Some Illustrations.</h3>

<p>It will be expected of course that for the claim here advanced
on behalf of the predominant influence of the nervous system in the
initiative of the evolutionary process some experimental or other<span class="pagenum" title="232"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
evidence should be produced. Before entering upon this, I think
some analogous facts from the story of man, in accordance with the
principle laid down in the first chapter should be stated, so as
to illustrate the line of thought. These will be in the nature of
analogies, and whether or not the accepted accounts of the chosen
examples agree precisely with the last word of the critics is
immaterial, for if not they will equally well serve the purpose of
illustra­tion.</p>


<h3>Abraham.</h3>

<p>When from his Mesopotamian home an opulent and successful
farmer decided for reasons sufficient to himself that he would leave
his present prosperity for a promised land, and went out not knowing
whither he went, it is manifest that the construc­tion and organiza­tion
of Abraham’s cerebral cortex was the motive power which
led to this step so fraught with change to himself, his descendants,
and the world. By his choice he showed the inherited structure
of his brain, its nature, and perhaps its nurture, to be different
from those of his family and tribe. Implicit in this venture was
the introduc­tion of a new group of people into a new environment,
and their reaction to it through many generations is written before
our eyes to-day in indelible characters. It was neither stature,
muscular development, colour of hair, skin or eyes, properties of
digestive or circulatory organs, keenness of sight, hearing, taste,
smell, or touch which led to this result even though without a high
degree of efficiency of these he could never have “arrived” as he did.</p>


<h3>Mohammed.</h3>

<p>The conjunc­tion of environment with a certain organized
complexity of grey matter was hardly ever more important to the
world than that of Mohammed. The powerful frame, abundant
black hair, wonderful dark eyes, and great imposing head may
well have attracted the rich widow who “made his fortune” by
marrying him, and they stood him in good stead in his later adventurous
career. But nothing short of a unique arrangement of his
reflex-arcs, chiefly in the associa­tion-areas of his brain, could have
opened up to him the world of Asia and Europe.</p>


<h3>Columbus.</h3>

<p>Who can doubt that it was ultimately to the inherited structure
of the convolutions of his brain that Columbus owed his great
achievement in opening up a New World; or that to the reactionary
and intense “character” of Philip’s brain the persecutions in the
Netherlands were due; and on the other hand that to the brain<span class="pagenum" title="233"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
of William of Orange with its liberal and enlightened “character”
the Seven Provinces that resisted Philip owed their freedom; the
results in the two cases being the decay of Spain from that time
forward, and the final success in the struggle for religious liberty.
In such a view of historical facts it is not necessary either to follow
Carlyle in his extreme claims for the influence of great men and
heroes, nor to look upon the hero as an epiphenomenon. It is
certain that eventually some other great man would have arisen
to do what the great Genoese did, if he had not done it, and as it
is claimed that Amerigo di Vespucci did, and it is certain that
Philip was only the last of the Hapsburg sovereigns who determined
the fall of Spain, and that Huss, Jerome, Wycliffe and Luther
in their days initiated the struggle for religious liberty which
Holland brought to success. But the facts referred to can hardly
be disputed, and the men and their “characters” did certainly
determine permanent changes in the world.</p>


<h3>Napoleon.</h3>

<p>Among individual men of modern times none strikes the
imagina­tion as does Napoleon. Without ignoring the tremendous
outburst of the soul of down-trodden France at the Revolu­tion,
it cannot be denied that the “character” or grey matter of brain
of the man of whom it is said “nothing where he had passed was
as it had been before,” was the dominant and natural fact that
changed the face of Europe. What physical quality had Napoleon,
except those of his grey cells, which could have led him to such
results on the environment into which he was cast?</p>


<h3>Migrations.</h3>

<p>Similar results in nations and tribes can easily be supplied
from the great migrations of the past. The wider movements
are but due to comparatively small aggregates of adventurous men,
in other words to the aggrega­tion of many similar central nervous
systems. The great Western and Southern adventures of the
Scythian Tribes had many contributing causes on which the
historian has much to say, and they were physically highly efficient
for their new career, but, reduced to the simplest elements, it was
neither their great stature, strong muscles, flaxen hair, nor blue
eyes, but the cerebral constitu­tion of a comparatively small group
of them which brought part of the nation to the promised land,
and left another and large part in their homes beyond and along
the Danube. The subsequent story of the latter may well be
compared with the invaders of Gaul and Italy in connec­tion with
initiative in evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="234"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span></p>

<p>The successive invasion of Britain by Low German tribes
in the fifth century, and the Scandinavian hordes of Swedes, Danes,
Norwegians, Letts and Finns in the eighth and ninth teach the
same lesson. The later condition and development of the Northmen
in France, Italy, Spain, Sicily and Britain have only to be compared
for a moment with that of their races who remained in Norway,
Sweden and Denmark and their descendants, to bring clearly
before one’s mind the profound influence exerted by the cerebral
constitu­tion of the original Viking hosts on their career in their
new environments, and, indeed, on the environments themselves;
as in intermarriage with their conquered foes.</p>

<p>These examples have been chosen for the reason that one
feature is common to them all, the introduc­tion of an individual
or group into new environments by reason of the constitu­tion of
their brains, irrespective of the contributing factors. If these
be sound analogies they bear closely on the matter of initiative
in the evolution of new forms of life. The men in question came
to their task, in their day, with a certain equipment of brain derived
from many ancestors and much nurture. Unconscious arbiters
of their fate and that of multitudes who should follow them, they
initiated a course of physical and cerebral evolution of which we
can see much revealed before our eyes. The motive power of their
conduct bears a relation to their physical forms that the engines
of a motor-car do to its varied forms of body. The latter are
modified indefinitely to suit convenience, comfort and grace, but
fundamentally they exist and are energised by the former, just as
structure is modified for the performance of function.</p>

<p>This fact is occasionally brought vividly to the mind of an
observer when he first passes a Rolls-Royce car in all its glory and
magnificence, and then a rough squalid kind of trolly in which the
engine-parts of a similar future Rolls-Royce are out for trial.
In principle it is not a long step from these illustrations to the
diverse environments of animals in which their lot is cast, and
their reaction to them as to behaviour and structural change.</p>


<h3>Some Changes in Habits of Man.</h3>

<p>There are two current views as to the present erect posture
of man, one which traces it to the adoption of a new posture by a
pronograde four-footed ancestor, and the other that man’s ancestors
were “never typically pronograde with four supporting limbs,”
but derived from an arboreal stock in which the forelimbs were
mobile rather than stable. Whenever or wherever man became
orthograde he opened up for himself and his descendants immense<span class="pagenum" title="235"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
regions of structural and functional change and became increasingly
dominant over his environment. Changes in muscles, joints,
bones, bursæ, lungs, heart, and vessels occurred through his employing
in new modes the muscles, joints, bones, bursæ, lungs, heart
and vessels he already possessed, and the resemblance between
these structures of man and the great apes has given to the latter
the name of anthropoid, and this similarity of structures in the
highest Primates has done much to support in the past that Simian
origin of man which is at present questioned. The behaviour of
the apes and early man were sufficiently alike to lead either to
a parallel or genetic similarity. This point is, perhaps, irrelevant
in considering the great field for initiative in the formation of new
physical characters, and chief among these new reflex-arcs which
have built up the marvellous organ of man’s glory and greatness;
but no one can dispute the elementary fact that the ancestor of
man who adopted terrestrial bipedal locomo­tion and became
orthograde, owed it to his growing brain and the higher integra­tion
of his organs for that function. But besides the new posture he
had adopted he learned to talk articulately, to make tools, and to
use stereoscopic vision. None of these could have been started
on the upward way without a long process of trial and error in the
course of his total experience and practice of his powers. The
results that followed from these three properties of his are inconceivably
great, and it is unnecessary to enlarge on such a theme
or to add to the number of examples.</p>

<p>Leaving, then, the immediate ancestor to work out his own
destiny in his new terrestrial home, we must as before proceed
backward in the history of animal life in the line of Primate ancestry.</p>


<h3>Primate Ancestry.</h3>

<p>It is generally agreed to trace the Primates back to an active
pioneer animal form which took to the trees, and which arose out
of the widely-spread Insectivores. This deriva­tion will probably
satisfy any reasonable genealogist. But, if we may use a parallel
in human families, this active animal was as different from its
congeners as Napoleon was from his four brothers who played a
part in European history, and it is not necessary to say more as to
the significance of this fact than that the relative importance of
“chassis” and “body” is again a useful analogy. But we need to
ask what those congeners did if we are to succeed in understanding
the Napoleon-like course of him who became our Primate ancestor.
From the original widely-spread and plastic raw material of the
Insectivores allied forms took different lines, and their stories are<span class="pagenum" title="236"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
written at great length in one small and the three other great orders
of Bats, Carnivores, Ungulates, and Rodents. As it has been
pointed out, Carnivores took to attacking larger prey, including
their less fortunate relatives, and stepped into the arena as carnivorous
animals; the Ungulates-to-be became herbivorous and developed
into two great groups of hoofed animals, relying mainly on
flight for safety; Rodents took to burrows for defence, ceased to
trouble much about attack, and became gnawing animals; Bats
adopted an aerial life—a poor form of it indeed like that of the
aeroplane—and acquired a degraded fore-limb. Before leaving
these great orders of animals, whom I do not desire to compare
unfavourably with poor Louis, Jerome, Joseph or Lucien Bonaparte,
it is convenient here to refer to a fact which comes to light immediately
one looks into such a piece of classifica­tion as this of the
orders arising out of the loins of the early Insectivores, and that is
the functional concep­tion underlying it. Doubtless pure functional
“characters” could never supply a whole system of classifica­tion
in the light of the modern doctrine of descent with modifica­tion,
and of zoological affinities. This is shown in a change from division
of six orders of Birds-Running, Swimming, Wading, Climbing,
Predatory and Perching Birds, to that of a few old-fashioned
Ratite Birds, and all the rest, one which seems the best that can be
offered at present.</p>


<h3>Insects, Mollusca, Birds.</h3>

<p>The grouping of animals by structural characters, and by
affinities which are assumed, though based on almost undeniable
evidence, whether into species, families, classes, phyla or sub-phyla,
has its apotheosis in Mollusca and Insects. As to the second of these
immense groups it has always seemed strange that their colourings
and structural characters should have received such intensive study
from Weismann to the exclusion of Mollusca, when he set out to
prove his stupendous negative, and still more that of Vertebrates,
among which his chief difficulty and desired triumph would seem
to have lain. Mollusca though invertebrate are held by many to be
in the line of ancestry of the highest forms of life, and at any rate
insects are not. They are most fruitful fields indeed in which
Nature has been able to show what she could do by her stern
selective powers, but, from the point of view of descent with
modifica­tion, may be fairly compared to a review of an army in time
of peace, or the Kriegspiel of a German military staff. He who
concerns himself with the fundamental difficulties of the problems
at issue in evolution must make his notes of what experts tell him<span class="pagenum" title="237"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
of such groups as those of Insects, Mollusca and Birds, and pass
on to the higher forms in which on the one hand function becomes
the predominant partner, and on the other individual experience
becomes more and more important. He feels indeed at liberty to
wish the entomologist and ornithologist all success, and to leave
him at peace, in his siding, to pursue his delightful and interminable
studies far from the dust and din of controversy.</p>


<h3>Insectivores.</h3>

<p>The critical territory of vertebrate, and still more of Mammalian
forms, in which the genealogist pictures the five main groups of
Insectivores, looking about them, if one may so speak, in the
world around and pondering which of many paths they shall pursue,
resembles certain centres that may be seen in towns where three,
four, five, or seven different roads are open to the traveller, each
with its incalculable effects on his ultimate career. If one may
change here the metaphor it may be said that the Insectivores are
the watershed of the Five Rivers of higher life. However much
the wayfaring insect-feeders have diverged from this broad centre
in structure, and however much the laws of genetics have widened
this divergence, the facts of function stare one in the face when such
descriptions of three of the four orders outside the Primate stock
are pondered—Flesh-feeders, Herbivorous animals, Burrowers and
Gnawers. These time-honoured names appealed strongly to older
zoologists, and in them is implicit a large body of evidence for
initiative in their evolution by pioneering work on the part of their
ancestors. Though in these days Prototheria include Monotremes,
One-vent animals, Metatheria, Marsupials or pouched animals, and
Eutheria Insect-feeders, and though Mammals derive their indispensable
name from the function by which they feed their young,
the most severe of systematists cannot clear his mind from the old
leaven of function in all these terms. They imply momentous
potentialities prior to new structures, and the modern fails to ban
entirely such functional names. I believe there is here no juggling
with names and words on my part, but a stone in the founda­tion
of the unambitious building which I am seeking to rear. It is
ultimately connected with a directive power as well as the formation
of sensori-motor arcs in the central nervous system.</p>

<p>Is it possible or probable that the factors which led some group
to the water alone, some to a life in water and on land at different
parts of their lives, some to a crawling life on land and partly in
water, some to the air and trees, some to nocturnal, some to hybernating,
some to burrowing life, some to a diet of flesh, some to one of<span class="pagenum" title="238"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
plants, some to the trees alone, some to the trees and land, some
to the land by night and trees by day, and some for ever and wholly
to the land—is it probable that any process of selection of suited
structures with countless ages of trial and error, could have determined
these changes of habit and habitat? At least one may
claim that the balance of probabilities is heavily against that view,
and that the forging of reflex-arcs, with all it means to the career
of an individual, affords a more intelligible hypothesis, and that
this is strongly supported by modern discoveries and doctrines
arising from the work of physiologists, as will appear later.</p>


<h3>The Place of the Nervous System in Evolution.</h3>

<p>The constitu­tion of the nervous system is conditioned by
conduc­tion, its fundamental and primary function. Its processes
consist in the transmission of impulses from receptive fields to
effective reactions through devious paths in a region which, even
to-day, is a jungle, with many further secrets for physiology to
reveal. From this point of view the nervous system may be looked
at as a clearing-house and storehouse of impulses <i>on their way in</i>,
<i>on their way through</i>, and <i>on their way out</i>. If so, the making of new
reflex-arcs is a process which has gone on simultaneously with the
formation of receptors in the skin, the higher sense-organs and such
deep structures as muscles, and that of effectors of infinite variety—and
these are called conveniently adaptations. When we hear
from Professor Sherrington that the afferent fibres with their
private paths which enter the spinal cord outnumber three times
those which leave it, and that those of the cranial nerves should
be added, so that the afferent fibres may be reckoned as five times
more numerous than the efferent, we get a vivid idea of the fundamental
importance of the formation and compounding of reflex-arcs
into systems. Without that the most sensitive receptors and
the widest range of structures and organs, small and great, would
be as nothing and things of naught.</p>

<p>A neurone is the anatomical, as the reflex-arc is the functional
unit of a central nervous system. Just as it is profitless to consider
apart the engines and body of a motor car, as working machine,
so is it to picture neurones and reflex-arcs separately in the living
nervous system except for the purpose of an ideal construc­tion.
In common with the organs and structures of higher animals they
have to pass, as historical structures, through the stages of initia­tion,
repeti­tion of rudimentary function, and selection by trial and error,
till the “canalizing force of habit” issues in rudimentary and
increasingly efficient effectors. It is in this final stage where the<span class="pagenum" title="239"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
triumphs of selection have been won, and where their undeniable
value and interest has led some exponents of the distributional
laws of genetics to disregard, or accept as data, the early and formative
stages. Theirs is a mental state which resembles that of
Darwin, who, for once in a moment of haste, declared the question
of the origin of life to be rubbish.</p>

<p>In the foregoing considera­tion of the formation of receptors
of the skin it was assumed that certain common stimuli of the
environment hammer out for themselves paths in the nerve-fibrils
of the skin and by ceaseless repeti­tion lay down not only the receptor,
which may be called the <i>terminus a quo</i>, but also the afferent fibres
which ultimately find their way into the grey matter of the cord
and brain. That this is the initial stage of the construc­tion of the
higher nervous system can hardly be denied. But it carries the
problem of the synthesis of the organism but a little way unless
it be coincident with the construc­tion of new reflex-arcs and their
co-ordina­tion into systems. Till this stage be reached in a rudimentary
form the most cunning and exact adaptations and structures,
or, as they may be broadly called effectors, will not advance
the efficiency of the organism in the smallest degree. If the receptor
be the <i>terminus a quo</i> the effector is the <i>terminus ad quem</i>. This is
so obvious that it may be waved aside as a truism not worth the
notice of a zoologist concerned with the major problems of biology.
It may seem to challenge in a highly speculative region and manner
the labours of the biometrician and Mendelian, but, if fairly met
it no more encroaches on their territory than do the labours of the
engineers who invented the first and crudest chassis of a motor
car upon the elaborate and brilliant ingenuity, taste and skill of
the coachbuilders who turn out the “body” of a sumptuous Rolls-Royce
of 1920. But the latter would never have “arrived” if the
former had not made his slow and arduous trials and errors and
final success. So here, as in many other subjects, a truism has its
use. If the biometrician and Mendelian will only abstain from
erecting notice-boards to proclaim “No thoroughfare here,” we
shall not be put down as trespassers or poachers on their ground
and may range at large in certain fields of specula­tion.</p>


<h3>Some Neural Phenomena.</h3>

<p>Among numerous phenomena of nervous reactions discovered
by the research of physiologists certain have a close bearing on the
formation of receptors, afferent fibres and reflex-arcs, especially
those of Delay, Summation, Fatigue, Block or Resistance, Localiza­tion,
Facilita­tion and Inhibi­tion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="240"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span></p>


<h3>Facilitation.</h3>

<p>But of all these important reactions in nervous tissues none
bears so closely on the problem of the formation of reflex-arcs as
that of Facilita­tion. This is equivalent to the Law of Neural Habit
of the physiological psychologist, and is bound up with the highly
important Law of Forward Direction, which Professor Starling
says might as well be spoken of as the Irreciprocal conduc­tion of
nerve-arcs. The Law of Forward Direction of sensori-motor arcs
is too well known to need here any descrip­tion. But when this law
is taken into account the phenomenon of Facilita­tion is seen to
throw a strong light upon the earliest and rudimentary formation
of specialized nerve-fibres, reflex-arcs and Final Common Paths
leading to the effector glands or muscles. Facilita­tion is described
shortly by Professor Starling as follows. If the passage of a nervous
impulse across a synapse or series of synapses in the central nervous
system be too often repeated, fatigue is produced, and there is an
increase of the block at each synapse. If, however the stimulus
be not excessive and the impulse not too frequently evoked, the
effect of a passage of an impulse once is to diminish the resistance,
so that a second applica­tion of the stimulus provokes the reaction
more easily, and he adds that the result of summation of stimuli
is in fact in the direction of removal of block. When an impulse
has passed once through a certain set of neurones to the exclusion
of others it will tend, other things being equal, to take the same
course on a future occasion, and each time it traverses this path
the resistance in the path will be smaller. Education then is the
laying down of nerve-channels in the central nervous system, while
still plastic, by this process of Facilita­tion along fit paths, combined
with inhibi­tion (by pain) in the other unfit paths. He makes the
important statement that Facilita­tion is of great interest in connec­tion
with the development of “long paths” in the central
nervous system and, <i>more especially with the acquirement of new
reactions by the higher animals</i>. (Italics not in the original).</p>


<h3>Raw Materials of the Central Nervous System.</h3>

<p>The raw materials of higher central nervous systems are
furnished even in lowly Vertebrates by the neurones and their
processes, and the pathways into the grey matter by the “canalizing
force of habit” in the receptors and afferent fibres. Facilita­tion,
discovered in higher Vertebrates, such as dogs and cats, throws
backwards a light on the earliest struggles towards success and
integra­tion among phyla, sub-phyla and smaller groups, and here
again the well-known may lead to the less-known. We may then<span class="pagenum" title="241"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
frame a legitimate hypothesis, or at least an ideal construc­tion
of trials and errors and success, if those of lower levels were ever to
be introduced to the career of progress and achievement. But to
make good this claim it is necessary that it be based on the important
doctrine taught by Hughlings Jackson of the three (or more) levels
of sensori-motor arcs—those of the spinal or lowest, of the sensory
or intermediate, and those of the third or highest level, in which
the associa­tion-areas of the Primate brain are at once the means
and the title to his primacy, or headship of the sentient world.
The light of this doctrine guides the mind backwards to the frog-stage
of animal evolution with its highly organized congenital
system of arcs of the spinal level, so efficient for its life that, even
when the brain is removed, the frog can execute under certain
stimuli a purposeful complicated movement such as that of trying
to wipe away with its foot an irritant drop of acid applied to its
head or back; or, still more, if touched lightly between the scapulæ,
will “lower its head at the first touch, and again more so at a
second, and at a third will, besides lowering the head, draw the
front half of its trunk slightly backwards; at a fourth the same
movement with stronger retrac­tion; at a fifth give an ineffectual
sweep with its hind or fore-foot; at a sixth a stronger sweep; at
a seventh a feeble jump; at an eighth a free jump, and so on.”
Probably such an animal as the frog has all its reflexes congenitally
organized, whereas a dog, reaching the sensory level, has added
countless reflex-arcs to those inherited from its early ancestors of
the Insectivores which had long emerged from the spinal level,
retaining its old, perfecting its new inheritance, and eliminating
the unfit. Perhaps a faint picture of this long process may be
afforded by watching an experienced mountain guide ascending
an ice-slope with the aid of ice-axe, hand and foot.</p>


<h3>Integration of Raw Materials.</h3>

<p>Every group of animals in the higher ranks has its own entailed
property of innate reflexes, for example, the reflexes which subserve
the reflex functions of the cord: those of locomo­tion, muscular
and vascular tone, micturi­tion, defæca­tion, impregna­tion and
parturi­tion. These exist in an animal of the spinal level whether
or not it remains purely aquatic, partly aquatic, partly terrestrial,
arboreal or terrestrial. As the progressive groups ascend the ladder
of life they add to this inalienable heritage, gained we need not here
ask how, fresh reflex-arcs by response to new initial stimuli, forging
them by the incident of use. So, the original acquirements in the
past levels serve as starting points for raising the degree of their<span class="pagenum" title="242"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
nervous integra­tion with growing control over their environments.
The long story from the simple central nervous system of a fish,
with a few or no associa­tion-areas, to that of man with his extensive
frontal, parietal, parieto-occipital associa­tion-areas, could never
be deciphered, even with the light of the laws of genetics turned
on full, without a protracted process of construc­tion of fresh arcs.
A common illustra­tion of such a series of changes and results may
be seen in the building of a house. Bricks, founda­tion-stones,
walls and a roof may serve some of the elementary requirements
of a house and much less than these were of use to early man for
his shelter. Without them we cannot call any structure a modern
house; but also without floors, staircases, windows, chimneys,
division into rooms, some degree of decora­tion by paint or paper,
and a supply of water, we should refuse in these days the name of
house to that rough structure, apart from beauty of design, decora­tion,
within and without, and some addition of modern appliances
of comfort and convenience. In the history of house-building the
stages of supply of raw materials, adapta­tion to needs guided by
selection, initia­tion, trial and error have their counterpart in the
construc­tion of higher animals.</p>


<h3>Evidence.</h3>

<p>It will be asked what evidence there is for the view here put
forward that such is the order and method of the construc­tion of
the central nervous system. There are two classes of evidence.
The first direct, and the second indirect and resting on inference.
The well-known leads to the less-known and inferred. Direct
evidence of the founda­tion of new reflex-arcs and their organiza­tion
is of course small. The conditions, such as the duration of human
life, preclude any extensive formation under experiment of new
reflex-arcs, but enough is known to enable one to follow the backward
way with some confidence. As to the inheritance of these,
the evidence rests on opinion and tremendous probability, but as
the only problem with which I am concerned here is that of initiative
I think it better to leave the matter of transmission to a dispassionate
considera­tion of the probability of its occurrence.</p>


<h3>Direct Evidence.</h3>

<p>The prolonged researches of over twelve years of Professor
Pawlow and his colleagues on dogs afford a body of evidence as to
the possibility of producing new reflexes in the life of an individual
which have never been questioned. In 1913 at Groningen, before
the International Congress of Physiologists, he gave a brief account<span class="pagenum" title="243"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
of this work. His previous work on the digestive glands carried
on by delicate operations in which the œsophagus was diverted from
the stomach and made to open externally, and in which a portion
of the stomach was diverted from the rest and a new “small
stomach” was formed, gave him the opportunity of immensely
important insight into the factors governing the work of the various
glands of the stomach. The work of others showed similar results
in the pancreas. I only refer to these because they lead up to the
special artificial results with new reflexes which he described in
1913. He states that the nervous system besides the primitive
function of reproducing innate reflexes, possesses another prime
function-namely the formation of new reflexes; and that the
living thing is enabled to respond, by definite and suitable activities
to agencies to which it was formerly indifferent. His experiments
on the formation of “conditional reflexes,” as he calls them rather
than “acquired” as opposed to “innate,” are grouped around the
feeding of the animal and mainly deal with the salivary glands,
because they are in direct connec­tion with the external world and
their reactions are simply and easily observed. An indifferent
stimulus is chosen for the reflexes which it is desired to build up,
and this is applied at the same time as food or acid is introduced
in the mouth. After a few sittings it is found that this indifferent
stimulus <i>alone</i> is now capable of calling forth a secretion of saliva.
“The conditional reflex has been formed; the formerly indifferent
stimulus has now found a path to the requisite part of the central
nervous system. The reflex-arc has now a different afferent
neurone.” He gives a good example of this in the result of the
applica­tion of painful stimuli by a strong electrical current to the
skin, systematically accompanying each feeding of the animal.
He finds that the strongest electrical stimuli applied to the skin
give rise merely to the “feeding reaction,” that is, the secretion
of saliva, and no indications of any fright or pain appear. “The
skin of a dog can be subjected to cutting, pinching or burning, and
the only result we shall obtain will be the manifesta­tion of what,
judging from our own experience, we should call the symptoms of
the keenest appetite; the animal follows the experimenter about,
licks himself, and saliva flows in abundance.” This, it must be
remembered, occurs in the absence of the offer or sight of food, <i>at
the time in question</i>. He adds: “In this way we have been able
to divert the impulses from one path to another according to the
conditions, and we cannot avoid the conclusion that the diversion
of an impulse from one path to another represents one of the most
important functions of the highest parts of the central nervous<span class="pagenum" title="244"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span>
system.” The presence of certain special conditions, he points out,
causes the indifferent stimulus, which would otherwise be dispersed
in the higher centres, to be directed to a particular focus, and
<i>eventually to lay down for itself a path to that part</i>. A very interesting
detail of such a building of a new reflex is that “the stimuli from
which the new reflex is to be worked out shall be rigidly isolated.”
Therefore to avoid any interference with the certainty of the experiment,
such matters as a personal bodily odour or kind of movement,
or even such a slight fact as a change in the mode of breathing
familiar to the dog on the part of the experimenter, has in the latest
experiments been removed by the applica­tion of the stimuli by
mechanical devices worked from another room, with results similar
to the earlier ones. Conditional reflexes can also be obtained from
stimuli arising from the locomotor apparatus, as the joints, eliminating
the stimuli arising from the skin. Also certain parts of the
frontal lobes were extirpated and “when one part is extirpated the
reflex is obtained from the flexion of the joint, but not from the
skin; if a different part be removed we can get the skin-reflex, but
not the reflex from the joint.” He extirpated in one case the
greater portion of the posterior part of the brain and the dog lived
for several years after this in complete health. It was found easy
to obtain a conditional reflex for various intensities of illumina­tion,
also for sound, and even a fine differentia­tion of tones. In another
dog the anterior half of the brain was removed and all the reflexes
before worked out in this animal disappeared, and yet in this
helpless condition of the dog he could train it to give that response
of the salivary glands which he called the “water-reflex,” in which
first of all an irritating acid was introduced into the mouth and the
subsequent administra­tion of water provoked an abundant secretion
of saliva which does not occur when water is poured into the mouth
of a normal dog. This was confirmed in another example in which
alone the centre for smell had been spared, and yet it was possible
in it to train the smell-reflexes also. I add one striking sentence
from Pawlow’s address which, though an opinion, must be received
with the respect it deserves from such a source. “It is perhaps
not rash to think that some of the newly-formed conditional reflexes
can be transmitted hereditarily and become unconditional thereby.”</p>


<h3>Indirect Evidence.</h3>

<p>From these limited but cogent pieces of evidence I turn to the
larger but confirmatory lines of indirect evidence and inference,
of which such works as those of Professors Sherrington, Bayliss, and
Starling, the notable address of Professor Macdonald at Portsmouth<span class="pagenum" title="245"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
in 1911, as well as the recent work of Professor Woods Jones on
Arboreal Man, are full. Indeed if the construc­tion of new reflexes
and reflex-arcs in organic evolution “forged by an incident of use”
as Professor Macdonald puts it, were expunged from these works,
their treatment of the physiology of the central nervous system
of higher animals would be emasculated, to say the least of it. And
yet not one of these eminent men is writing <i>ad hoc</i>, or for the confusion
of Weismann and his followers. At this point it may perhaps
gain for the remaining pages a little more considera­tion from
opponents if I give a few quotations from these writers in support
of the foregoing statement—perhaps the breeze of authority may
then carry my little bark a little further on its perilous voyage.
Professor Sherrington remarks on the first page of his well known
work, in reference to the cell-theory, “with the progress of natural
knowledge, biology has passed beyond the confines of the study
of merely visible form, and is turning more and more to the subtle
and deeper sciences that are branches of energetics. The cell-theory
and the doctrine of evolution find their scope more and more,
therefore, in the problems of function, and have become more and
more identified with the aim and incorporated among the methods
of physiology.” Again, “Mere experience can apart from reason
mould nervous reactions in so far as they are plastic. The ‘bahnung’
(or facilita­tion) of a reflex exhibits this in germ.” He uses more
than once the pregnant phrase, “The canalizing force of habit”;
again, “Progress of knowledge in regard to the nervous system has
been indissolubly linked with the determina­tion of function in it.”
Speaking of the receptive-field he says of the central nervous system,
“To analyse its action we turn to the receptor organs, for to them
is traceable the initia­tion of the reactions of the centres”; of the
extero-ceptive field he says, “facing outwards on the general
environment it feels and has felt for countless ages the full stream
of the varied agencies for ever pouring upon it from the external
world,” page&nbsp;20, and “each animal has experience only of those
qualities of the environment which as stimuli excite its receptors,
it analyses its environment in terms of them exclusively. The
integra­tion of the animal associated with these leading segments
can be briefly with partial justice expressed by saying that the rest
of the animal, so far as its motor machinery goes, is but the servant,
of them. Volitional movements can certainly become involuntary,
and conversely, involuntary movements can sometimes be brought
under the subjec­tion of the will. From this subjec­tion it is but a
short step to the acquisi­tion of co-ordinations which express themselves
as movements newly acquired by the individual,” and,<span class="pagenum" title="246"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span>
“The integrating power of the nervous system has, in fact, in the
higher animal more than in the lower, constructed from a mere
collec­tion of organs and segments a functional unity, an individual
of more perfected solidarity,” also “a single momentary shock
produces in the nervous arc a facilitating influence on a subsequent
stimulus applied even 1400σ later.” I will give but one more
statement from this work which seems to tell against my humble
position of initiative in evolution. Professor Sherrington says
at the end of his book, speaking of the adjustments of nervous
reactions in the lifetime of the individual: “These adjustments
though not transmitted to the offspring yet in higher animals
form the most potent internal condition for enabling the species
to maintain and increase in sum its dominance over the environment
in which it is immersed.” A little care in reading the foregoing
chapters will show that this in no way contradicts the views
expressed.</p>


<h3>Facilitation.</h3>

<p>From Professor Starling’s Principles of Human Physiology
I may again quote part of his account of Facilita­tion or “Bahnung.”
“When an impulse has passed through a certain set of neurones
to the exclusion of others it will tend, other things being equal, to
take the same course on a future occasion, and each time it traverses
this path the resistance in the path will be smaller. Education
is the laying down of nerve-channels in the central nervous system,
while still plastic, by the process of ‘Bahnung’ along fit paths
combined with inhibi­tion (by pain) in the other unfit paths. Memory
itself has the process of facilita­tion for its neural basis,” again,
“stimula­tion of one anterior root produces no definite movement
of a group of muscles, but partial contrac­tion of a number of muscles
which do not normally contract simultaneously. Thus, stimula­tion
of a sensory nerve may provoke either flexion or extension of a
limb, not both simultaneously. Stimula­tion of the motor roots
will cause simultaneous contrac­tion of both flexor and extensor
muscles. It is <i>this subordina­tion of morphological to physiological
arrangements</i> in the limbs which has necessitated the founda­tion
of limb-plexuses.” (Italics not in the original). Professor Graham
Kerr in his work on Embryology before mentioned says: “In early
stages of Evolution, whether phylogenetic or ontogenetic, we may
take it that vital impulses flitted hither and thither in an indefinite
manner within the living substance and that one of the features of
progressive evolution has been the gradual more and more precise
defini­tion of the pathways of particular types of impulse, as well<span class="pagenum" title="247"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
as the transmitting and receiving centres between which they pass.
We may then regard the appearance of neuro-fibrils within the
protoplasmic rudiment of the nerve-trunk as the coming into view
of tracks, along which, owing to their high conductivity, nerve-impulses
are repeatedly passing. It may be that as each successive
passer-by causes a jungle-pathway to become more clearly defined
so each passing impulse makes the way easier for its successors and
makes it less likely for them to stray into the surrounding substance”
(p.&nbsp;112).</p>

<p>Professor Macdonald, in the Portsmouth address referred to,
speaking of the states of the cells under excita­tion, rest, and inhibi­tion,
says “<i>excita­tion</i> is associated with an increase in pressure of
certain particles within the cells; in <i>rest</i> these particles are in their
normal quantity and have their normal number. During <i>inhibi­tion</i>
they are decreased in number or have a retarded motion. Thus
it happens that the excited cell tends to grow in size, on the other
hand the inhibited cell tends to diminish, and the resting cell to
remain unaltered in the nervous system. Structure is everywhere
the outcome of function.” Speaking of the relationship of parts
within the nervous system, “In so far as it is fixed, it is a sign of
the orderly action of circumstance upon the structures of the body,
and the result rather than the cause of the monotony of existence.
I hold it as probable that all the individual structures of the nervous
system, and so in the brain, have just so much difference from one
another in size and shape and in function as is the outcome of that
measure of physical experience to which each one of them has been
subjected; and that the physiological function of each one of them
is of the simplest kind. The magnificent utility of the whole system,
where the individual units have such simplicity, is due to the
physically developed peculiarities of their arrangement in relation
to one another, and to the receptive surfaces and motor-organs of
the body.” As to the lens-system of the eyeball he remarks,
“Surely there is no escape from the statement that either external
agency cognisant of light, or light itself has formed and developed
to such a state of perfec­tion this purely optical mechanism, and that
natural selection can have done no more than <i>assist</i> in this process.”
He applies the same conclusion to the formation of the sound-conducting
and resonant portion of the ear as well as the semi-circular
canals and to the cerebellum. These statements are not
strictly associated with this chapter but bear by analogy very
strongly on the matter at issue. Indeed the whole of this address
might be utilised by a junior counsel for Lamarck if he rested alone
on the authority of a leading physiologist. The same may be said<span class="pagenum" title="248"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
of the anatomist whose <i>Arboreal Man</i> has attracted so much
attention. Speaking of the arboreal habit in the phylogenetic
history of mammals he asks the question, “How did this factor
enable that particular stock to acquire supremacy?” and says
that it will be answered as far as it is possible, by the study of the
influence of the arboreal habit upon the animal body; which may
be put in another way as the produc­tion of reflex-arcs suited thereto
(p.&nbsp;3.) Of the muscle groups of fore and hind limbs he says, “With
a simple arrangement of anatomical parts a slight shifting of muscular
origins has turned a perfectly mobile second segment into a
supporting segment constructed upon very simple lines: that these
changes are those produced by the demands of support from the
hind-limbs in tree-climbing seems obvious” (p.&nbsp;6); of the position
of uprightness upon a flexed thigh of an arboreal man, “It is tree-climbing
which makes this posture a possibility” (p.&nbsp;63). “But
it is not to be doubted that the underlying principle is clear enough,
that the arboreal habit develops the specialised and opposable
thumb and big toe” (p.&nbsp;71). “Even before the power of grasp
is developed, we may imagine the dawn stages of educational
advances initiated by hand-touch” (p.&nbsp;159). “Tactile impressions
gained through the hand are therefore perpetually streaming into
the brain of an arboreal animal and new avenues of learning about
its surroundings are being opened up as additions to the olfactory
and snout-tactile routes” (p.&nbsp;160). He asks also the pertinent
question, and says at least a partial answer to it can be given, “Did
the cerebral advance create the physical adaptations, or did the
physical adaptations make possible a cerebral advance?” (p.&nbsp;196).
Two more statements from this chapter show what the answer
to this question from the <i>anatomist</i> would be—“and again in the
evolutionary story we are forced back to consider a combina­tion
of seemingly trivial, and apparently chance associations: in this
case the dawning possibilities of neo-pallial developments combined
with the physical adaptations <i>due directly to environmental influences</i>”
(p.&nbsp;198). I have ventured to underline this passage.</p>

<p>I regret the necessary length of these quotations but, on account
of them, can the better be suffered to finish this study, when I
briefly consider certain well-known nervous reactions in the cat
and dog as to their probable origin. It would be a highly interesting
thing to hear an exposi­tion by an expert of all the reflexes and reflex-arcs
of such a system as those which in a cat, dog, ape, or man are
concerned with the passage of a morsel of food from the mouth
through all its chequered and varied career till it undergoes metabolism
and excretion, but I could not do it if I would, and would<span class="pagenum" title="249"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
not here if I could, because of their fundamental fixed and innate
character, and I think it simpler and safer to refer to such minor
reflex-arcs as those which govern the scratch-reflex in a dog, the
pinna reflexes in a cat, and a few smaller ones, on the principle of
<i>ex uno disce omnes</i>. Such minor nerve-mechanisms as these in a
pair of well-known domesticated animals will suffice for evidence
on behalf of initiative in evolution.</p>


<h3>The Scratch Reflex.</h3>

<p>The scratch-reflex in the dog, which like the tendon-reflex
in man was in my youth a subject for schoolboy tricks, has received
a vast amount of attention and research from physiologists to whom
it has brought valuable fruit. It is a familiar phenomenon in a
familiar friend of man. There is a saddle-shaped area on the back
of the dog over which it was found empirically that even a light
stimulus when applied rhythmically, produces the “scalptor-reflex”
or a reflex rhythmical action of the flexor muscles of the
leg on the same side, calculated to remove the irritating causes
of the stimulus. This includes a series of receptors in the skin
leading to a spinal segment in the region of the shoulder, a long
neurone in the cord, then a motor neurone, the axon from which
activates the flexor muscles of the leg and produces scratching.
It is described as an efferent arc from receptor to the motor neurone,
from which the Final Common Path supplies the motor apparatus
or effector. Professor Sherrington says that in this reflex a single
stimulus which is far below threshold intensity is found on its
fortieth repeti­tion and nearly four seconds after its first applica­tion
to become effective and provoke the reflex and that its frequency
is about 4.5 per second. The reflex movement remains rhythmic
and clonic under the strongest as under weaker stimula­tion. When
it is easily elicitable the scratch-reflex can be evoked by various
forms of electrical as well as mechanical stimula­tion, but, when
not easily elicitable, electrical stimula­tion fails whereas rubbing
or other mechanical forms of stimuli still evoke it, though less
vigorously than usual. This reflex can also be set aside by the
“nociceptive arc from the homonymous foot” or, in other words,
a nocuous stimulus to the leg of that side produces “interferences
which amounts to inhibi­tion.” Empirically it is easy to notice
also that if the “scalptor-reflex” can be elicited on both sides of
the body, the dog when standing will momentarily lose the power
in the hind legs.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>—The rhythm of this reflex act is so special even to the
layman that lately I had a singular confirma­tion of its stereotyped<span class="pagenum" title="250"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
character, when lying awake at night and being puzzled by a curious
rhythmical scratching sound coming from my next door neighbour’s
back yard. It might have been taken by a wakeful person for
some mechanical work on the part of a burglar, but after listening
repeatedly to the apparently familiar sound I found that it came
from the kennel of a fox terrier kept by my neighbour.</p>


<h3>Purposes of Reflexes.</h3>

<p>All reflexes being purposive this particular innate reflex is
acknowledged to have for its purpose the grooming or cleaning of
the skin over its hereditary territory. This introduces its connec­tion
with initiative here propounded, and the justifica­tion for
its introduc­tion is contained in Professor Sherrington’s statement
that “In the analysis of the animal’s life as a machine in action
there can be split off from its total behaviour fractional pieces
which may be treated conveniently, though artificially, apart,
and among these are the reflexes we have been attempting to
decipher”—scratch-reflexes and others. There seems to be no
reason for the existence and stereotyped character of this reflex
except the need or rather the desire (if one may use a convenient
but inaccurate term) on the part of the dog to remove an irritant
which disturbs its comfort when at rest. Some “minor horrors,”
probably fleas moving across the skin-receptive field of its shoulder
and back, must be assumed to be the irritant in question. This
touches the great question of the initiative of this remarkable
reflex, which seems more fixed and powerful in the dog as we know
him than that other reflex which leads him to turn tail and flee
immediately he sees a boy stoop down as if to pick up a stone.
I dare say a clever advocate on the opposite side might impress a
jury by building up a case under which an adapta­tion to a protective
need would be conceived as responsible for the rapid flight at the
sight of the threatening attitude of the boy. Such a reconstruc­tion
is not required, for it is perfectly clear that in the history of the
domesticated dog the selection of such an adapted reflex could have
no place. The survival-value of this reflex would be nil, for the
number of dogs killed by a stone or maimed for life would be so
negligible that the produc­tion of a specialised reflex for the purpose
by selection or survival of the fittest would not arise. Obviously
the danger would be intermittent and rare; and dead dogs tell
no tales. On the other hand it would be highly unpleasant for
dogs to be hit by stones and educability would lead them to avoid
the stooping attitude associated with missiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="251"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span></p>

<p>We are told on high authority that not education but educability
is transmissible, and yet this humble reflex appears in very
young dogs that could hardly if ever have known the impact of a
stone. Incidentally we are compelled to remember how in past
battles of our youth the aim both of “ourselves and the enemy”
was deplorably poor, and not from want of practice. This school-boy-stone
reflex is either an example of educational effects transmitted
or of a minute bit of the unpacking of an original complexity
which it would require the brain of a de Quincey to work out. But
if we suppose the initial stages of such a stimulus as the occasional
impact of a stone in many generations to be slowly ingrained in the
skin-receptors, reflex-arcs and receptors we do not need opium
either for the acceptance of orthodox dogma or to aid us in the
Mendelian alternative to a very simple ideal construc­tion.</p>

<p>This digression bears on the initiative of the more important
scratch-reflex, and it is profitable to ask “are not both of these
reflexes in dogs examples of Evolution of the Indifferent?” Is it
possible to imagine that from its inception to its fully-formed state,
with a specialised territory of skin-receptors accurately mapped out,
with receptor neurones, reflex-arcs and adapted effectors, this
scratch-reflex can have arisen through Germinal Selection or
selective processes within the germ? At no stage can anything
more than a contribu­tion to more or less comfort to the animal be
held to result from its operation. It is strangely reminiscent of the
proceedings of an elderly man after lunch on a hot day when he
protects his head against house-flies with a handkerchief. I am
aware that it is but one of a large number of reflexes produced for
the purpose of grooming the trunk head or limbs of animals as low
down in the scale as the house-fly or grasshopper, many of which
were beautifully described a few years ago by Miss Frances Pitt
in the <i>National Review</i> in an article dealing with small mammals,
chiefly rodents. But I have availed myself here as elsewhere, of
the liberty of doing what Professor Sherrington says we may do,
and consider this scratch-reflex as split off from the rest of the
animal’s behaviour for the purpose of analysis. He also says in
discussing the subject of parasites moving across the receptive
surface of the skin that the ulterior purpose may be the removal
of what “would confuse its function as a receptive surface to more
significant environmental stimuli.” This statement is hypothetical
and the problem obscure; but at any rate we know this that the
removal of the parasite must conduce to the greater comfort of the
dog without any more recondite purpose. The one suggested by
Professor Sherrington would in some possible but very vague<span class="pagenum" title="252"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>
manner be referable to selection, but, whether the sugges­tion be
valid or not, it is almost impossible to suppose that a saddle-shaped
area of the kind described could be under the guidance of selection.
The law of Parcimony forbids. There is a close similarity between
this saddle-shaped area in the dog and that on the cow’s trunk
described in Chapter X. It is difficult to believe that from man
downwards to grasshoppers relief from mild irritating causes such
as this is not enjoyable to the particular animal, and yet indifferent
altogether as to its survival in the struggles of life for food and mates.
The “scalptor-reflex” only reaches the limits of the receptive
field of the scratch-reflex and it is contrary to observed facts that
parasites confine their depredations just to the region where the
formidable scalptor-reflex can reach. The wicked flea knows better
than that. The initiative of this reflex can well be pictured as
taking place in domesticated dogs and their wild ancestors whose
habitats in prehistoric times were probably infested with these
irritants to such a degree that no modern mind can conceive, and
the adequate stimuli, leading to receptors after ages of impact and
consequent hammering out pathways through certain reflex-arcs
until the required weapons of offence or effectors were organised
into a <i>defensive-offensive system</i>—were there in profusion. But a
great and fundamental principle of the evolutionary process such
as Selection is not honoured by being dragged in, even for forensic
purposes, to account for results which owe to the search for
comfort their perfec­tion of organisa­tion. I have personally seen
in some professional invalids of the softer sex nearly as perfect
adaptations to their comfort which in no way contributed to
their length of life. This may be put aside as irrelevant but it
is at least suggestive.</p>

<p>I submit the statement as to the scratch-reflex in the dog that
from beginning to end it is an <i>indifferent</i> mechanism and the probability
is immense that its initial stages were governed alone by
repeated stimuli from parasites which produced receptors, conducting
fibres afferent neurones and efferent neurones, leading
into the Final Common Path controlling the flexors of the hind
limb. It would then come under the Law of Subjective or Hedonic
Selection formulated by Professor Stout in the words: “Lines of
action, if and so far as they are unsuccessful, tend to be discontinued
or varied; and those which prove successful to be maintained.
There is a constant tending to persist in those movements and motor
attitudes which yield satisfactory experiences, and to renew them
when similar conditions recur; on the other hand those movements
and attitudes which yield unsatisfactory experiences tend to be<span class="pagenum" title="253"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
discontinued at the time of their occurrence, and to be suppressed
on subsequent similar occasions.”</p>

<p>In this connection a statement from Professor McDougall’s
work may be advantageously quoted. He says that “It is characteristic
of those (arcs) of the higher or third level that their organisa­tion,
their interconnections, by means of which the simpler neural
systems of great complexity, is <i>congenitally determined in a very
partial degree only</i>, and is principally determined in each individual
by the course of its experience. The arcs of the higher level thus
constitute the physiological basis or condition of docility, the power
of learning by experience.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> (My italics)</p>


<h3>Scratch Reflex of the Cat.</h3>

<p>There is a notable difference between the scratch-reflex of the
dog and that of the cat, especially as to the site of its receptive-field.
That of the dog has been referred to, but it appears to be
generally accepted that the cat has no such saddle-shaped or indeed
other area of skin receptive-field on its back or flanks. I have
repeatedly tried by various mechanical stimuli, applied both
irregularly and rhythmically, to evoke a scratch-reflex in a cat,
young or adult, on the surface corresponding to that of the dog,
and have found no response. This has been tried both when the
animal was awake and when asleep. But the receptive field of the
cat’s scratch-reflex has received careful and elaborate attention,
which is described in a paper by Professor Sherrington in the <i>Journal
of Physiology</i>, Vol.&nbsp;LI. No. 6. By means of delicate stimuli,
mechanical and electrical in a decerebrate cat, the receptive-field
of the scratch-reflex has been accurately delineated in the pinna,
and several other pure reflexes have been obtained. These are
protective of the pinna; some, the retrac­tion and folding reflexes
seem directed against irritant touches, <i>e.g.</i> the settling of fleas—or
against exposure to injury in fighting; others, the cover and
head-shake and scratch-reflexes against the ingress of foreign matter,
such as dust, water, insects, into the meatus and ampulla. The
threshold for their elicita­tion is extremely low, that is to say, they
require very gentle stimuli to evoke them, while with the exception
of the scratch-reflex they are elicited with difficulty and uncertainty
<i>by electrical stimuli</i> (My italics) to which the animal has been subjected
in the course of its total experience. He adds that the pinnal
reflexes are readily obtained in the normal animal, and I may allude
here to some small observations I made on a normal young cat<span class="pagenum" title="254"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
during profound sleep, recorded in <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 106, Sept. 2, 1920.
Light mechanical stimuli, applied during this state of deep sleep
to the internal surface of the pinna, especially close to the meatus,
produced first, twitching of the facial muscles on the same side;
second, as this ceased the fore foot was moved irregularly towards
the ear, and third, as this ceased a rhythmical scratching action
of the hind foot took its place, the rate of which seemed to be
exactly the same as that of the scratch-reflex in the dog evoked
from stimula­tion of the flank and back. I had not then, unfortunately
read more than an abstract of the above paper, but if the
full account be followed it will be seen that the various “territories”
belonging to all the former-reflexes are now known as well as the
frontiers of a European Kingdom. All I was able to do with this
unusual opportunity of a heavy sleep in a normal young cat was
to verify more roughly Professor Sherrington’s observations and
slightly to extend them <i>in respect of a sleeping animal</i>.</p>

<p>In the course of these observations on a young cat I examined
the various regions of the back and flanks with mechanical stimuli
of different degrees of strength. These were applied during sleep
and I found that it was more often during a moderate than a light
or deep sleep that the following results were shown—chiefly under
the stronger stimuli the tail was raised sharply and swept in a
circular way, and this would be repeated according as the stimulus
was applied; but at the same time there was shown a strong,
irregular twitching along the flank, extending forwards to a point
near the level of the shoulder. This latter reflex would appear to
be a reaction on the part of the panniculus carnosus. Both the
reflex of the muscles of the tail and this of the flanks appear to be
connected in their origin with movements of parasites in their
respective territories.</p>

<p>In considering the scratch-reflex in the cat a subtle bit of
adjustment is found. That coarse and simple scratching of its
ear, which we see so often in the cat, must have often astonished
us for its vigour and yet its bloodless character. This action is
of course a purposeful one, for it goes on when the animal is awake.
Here if anywhere this profoundly hedonistic animal shows that
for it the laws of comfort are its laws of conduct. It is clear that
there may be two processes or conditions involved in its bloodless
violence. On the one hand the reflex retractile mechanism of the
claws may be kept in abeyance by another reaction which is pre-potent;
on the other, it is a fact that the hind foot in the cat is
furnished with claws which are much blunter than those of the
fore foot. As far as I have been able to examine cats of different<span class="pagenum" title="255"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
ages I have found the claws of the hind foot more like the blunt
claws of a dog than the familiar sharp claws of the Felidæ. So in
the violent scratching referred to there may be a double reason
associated in the process. As to the difference in the sharpness of
the fore and hind claws it would appear to be remarkably like a
transmitted bit of adapta­tion initiated and kept in being by use
and habit in progression, for the hind foot in such animals as the
cat has a larger share in this action than the fore foot. But here
it is difficult as so often to assign to selection its possible share of
the adjustment.</p>

<p>Certain minor but persistent reflexes may be briefly mentioned
in support of this side of the evolutionary process. In the dog and
cat, as we know them, the action of the muscles of the tail by which
it is elevated during the act of defæca­tion is very suggestive of a
reflex acquired by a very small degree of physical comfort and
repeated in countless individuals, wild and domesticated. I have
seen not only this but a few small scratches made by a cat before
defæca­tion in a kitten as young as three weeks old. It is also
mentioned in illustra­tion of a vestigial character that a horse will
paw the ground with no immediate apparent object, the act being
derived from ancestors which thus cleared away snow from the
ground. This is claimed, doubtfully I think, as a vestige of a
formerly <i>useful</i> habit but seems more probably to be one of these
indifferent reflexes connected with comfort than with survival-value.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in this branch of the case for
Lamarck <i>v.</i> Weismann the indirect evidence from inference far
exceeds in amount that of direct experimental evidence, but
from the nature of the problem under considera­tion this could
not be otherwise.</p>

<p>If we may again look back in thought over the long series
of animals, from man downwards, we shall picture those of the
spinal level striving (with apologies for the use of an anthropomorphic
word) to reach the sensory level and finding out the fact
that few there be that enter therein. Again we see in vision the
higher creatures of the sensory level reaching forwards to the strait
paths of primate existence, and again finding the difficulty of self-advancement
that their predecessors found. We see the elect few
of these, by a happy combina­tion of nature and nurture, uprearing
to glory and honour the primate stock with its culmina­tion in man.
A long vista indeed and a vision, but assuredly no mere figment
of the imagina­tion, as some of the slender facts and arguments
here would seem to show. With Professor Bateson we personify<span class="pagenum" title="256"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
Nature in the story, with her wonted coyness betraying the fact
that though she is stern she has her tolerant moods; that she allows
her children, even that “insurgent son” who calls himself Homo
Sapiens, a genial liberty to frame new reflex-arcs which make for
his enjoyment of life in indifferent fields, and <i>that the great neural
process of Facilita­tion is the leading factor in their constructions and
probably also in more deeply-based systems of sensori-motor arcs</i>.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY.</h2>


<p>Though it be true that <i>dolus latet in generalibus</i>,
it is a more important truth that “without premature
generalisations the true generalisa­tion would never
be arrived at.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore I <span class="nowrap">conclude:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That Plasto-diēthēsis, or the moulding and
sifting processes experienced by organisms,
represents the beginning and end of higher
animal evolution; and that its wide hyphen
stands for the provinces where Mendelism,
Mutationism, Tetraplasty, Orthogenesis, and
the dynamical work of growth on Form, as
well as other factors yet to be discovered, can
range at large.</p>

<p>2. That personal selection is the leading form
of that process in higher animals, whereas
among Invertebrates, especially unicellular
forms, selection of groups is the rule.</p>

<p>3. That Initiative in animal evolution comes by
stimula­tion, excita­tion, and response in new
conditions, and is followed by repeti­tion of
these phenomena until they result in structural
modifications, transmitted and directed by
selection and the laws of genetics—a series of<span class="pagenum" title="258"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
events which agree with Neo-Lamarckian
principles.</p>

<p>4. That undesigned experiments in the arrangement
of the Mammalian hair, and the
produc­tion of new bursæ, as well as the
designed experiments of Pawlow, support the
foregoing claims, with which agree the converging
facts of—varieties of epidermis,
arrangement of the papillary ridges, flexures
of the palm and sole, the formation of the
plantar arch, the origin of certain muscles,
the innerva­tion of the human skin, and the
building of reflex-arcs.</p>

<p>5. That there is a large place in higher animals
for the Evolution of the Indifferent through
the action of use and habit.</p>

<p>6. That the position for Initiative in Evolution
here advanced is no bar to unlimited research.</p></div>

The above remark as to the jubilee-volume needs to be explained and
justified. In it there is an important essay on each of the great provinces of
Weismann, Mendel and de Vries, and in each of these the highest living exponent
speaks, Professors Weismann, Bateson and de Vries. Bateson expresses
admiration for Weismann’s destructive work, but shows plainly that he holds
it to have failed in its fundamental purpose. Nevertheless, by a neat <i>tour
d’addresse</i> he adopts Weismann’s uncompromising attitude on the inheritance
of acquired characters, which happens to agree exceedingly well with his own
scheme. He has but one insignificant reference to de Vries on p.&nbsp;95 where
he finds help for his doctrine.
</p>
<p>
Weismann makes no reference to Mendel or de Vries. De Vries makes
none to Weismann or Mendel, but without stating it in his essay he is known
to be in opposition to Weismann’s dogma on the inheritance of acquired
characters. These three eminent biologists would thus seem to have worked
on diverging lines. The two first agree heartily, Weismann explicitly and
Bateson by implication, as to the forbidden doctrine, “on the ground that it
closes the way to deeper insight”—in other words their mutually destructive
theories. So it stands thus in the book—Weismann throws over Lamarck,
Mendel and de Vries; Bateson throws over Weismann (as again in 1914)
and de Vries; de Vries ignores Weismann and Mendel.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Lock in his book on Variation, Heredity and Evolution, 1906, says
that Weismann practically ignores the evidence of Mendelism in heredity,
and adds, p.&nbsp;261, “But at the next step the Mendelian parts company with
Weismann.”
</p>
<p>
One cannot avoid noticing, incidentally, that the vast mass of work of
the biometricians led by Galton, Weldon and Professor Karl Pearson is
conspicuously absent from the book. Prof. J. Arthur Thomson says that
there should be no opposition between Mendelian and Galtonian formulæ,
“they are correlated, and ultimately they will be seen in complete harmony
as different aspects of the same phenomena. But it is simply muddleheadedness
which can find any opposition between a statistical formula applicable
to averages of successive generations breeding freely, and a physiological
formula applicable to particular sets of cases where parents with contrasted
dominant and recessive characters are crossed and their hybrid offspring are
inbred.”(a) concerning which see the Preface to Bateson’s <i>Mendel’s Principles
of Heredity</i>, 1902, with remarks on some of the Galtonians.

Romanes, <i>Examination of Weismannism</i>, p.&nbsp;115.
</p>
<p>
“It is doubtful if anything better as to Weismann’s theory of heredity can
be said to-day than Romanes said in 1893, and inasmuch as these two latter
or distinctive postulates are not needed for Weismann’s theory of heredity,
while they are both essential to his theory of evolution, I cannot but regret
that he should have thus crippled the former by burdening it with the latter.
Hence my object throughout has been to display, as sharply as possible, the
contrast that is presented between the brass (“iron” preferably) and the clay
in the colossal figure which Weismann has constructed. Hence also my
emphatic dissent from his theory of evolution does not prevent me from
sincerely appreciating the great value which attaches to his theory of heredity.
And although I have not hesitated to say that this theory is, in my opinion,
incomplete; that it presents not a few manifest inconsistencies, and even
logical contradictions; that the facts on which it is founded have always
been facts of general knowledge; that in all its main features it was present
to the mind of Darwin, and distinctly formulated by Galton; that in so far
as it has been constituted the basis of a more general theory of organic evolution
it has proved a failure; such considerations in no way diminish my cordial
recognition of the services which its distinguished author has rendered to
science by his speculations upon these topics. For not only has he been
successful in drawing renewed and much more general attention to the
important questions touching the transmissibility of acquired characters, the
causes of variation, and so on; but even those parts of his system which have
proved untenable are not without such value as temporary scaffoldings present
in relation to permanent buildings. Therefore, if I have appeared to play
the <i>role</i> of a hostile critic, this has been only an expression of my desire to
separate what seems to me the grain of good science from the chaff of bad
speculation.”</p></div>

I prefer to state the above passage rather than that on page&nbsp;179, which
is as follows: “The precise question is this: <i>Can a structural change in the
body, induced by some change in use or disuse, or by a change in surrounding
influence, affect the germ-cells in such a specific or representative way that the
offspring will through its inheritance exhibit, even in a slight degree, the modification
which the parent acquired?</i>” (Italics in original). The question is very
precise and important, but I employ that given above in preference as lending
itself better to the line of inquiry followed here.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">30</a>
The term “character” derives both from its etymological origin and
its application to biology a double-edged quality. This is of great value to the
study of Mendelism which can only or mainly work with “unit-characters,”
and it also serves the Weismann dogma well. In both cases the term obliterates
the conception of initial variation, and while serving the purposes of
these two great schools of thought it directs attention away from the early
minute and unimportant stages by which many <i>germinal</i> variations may have
arisen. If it had been coined for the purpose, which it was not, it would
have been a remarkable instance of polemic cunning. It will be evident in
the course of this study of initial variation, that the accredited and general
use of the term “character” begs the question far too manifestly for the
general use of biologists. If it be retained for the neo-Darwinian and
Mendelian provinces there is nothing to say against it, but I adopt here with
pleasure the alternative term, often used by Professor Thomson, “modification.”
This is wide enough to include the more clear-cut “character” so
long as one makes it clear that the latter is one of the germinal variations.
Further, I hold that his use of the term “transmission” instead of “inheritance”
is the more useful for a wide range of phenomena. As far as possible
I shall employ the expression “transmission of modifications,” instead of
that well-worn but often sophisticated expression “inheritance of acquired
characters.” This has been subjected by Sir Archdall Reid and Dr. Dixey,
to say nothing of others such as Mr. George Sandeman, to a somewhat bewildering
analysis. Thus the former says, “It follows that the so-called “acquirements”
are innate and “inherited” in precisely the same manner as the
so-called inborn characters.”* Dr. Dixey admits “that all characters are
both acquired and innate”** and goes on to say that the accepted meaning
of the terms was vague, that it led to confusion, and that it ought to be
dropped. For this remark of Dr. Dixey one may be thankful, but of my
friend Sir Archdall Reid I would ask what he is doing in this galley?</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">**<i>Nature</i>, Vol. 77, Feb. 1908, p.&nbsp;392.</span></p>

<p>Sir E. Ray Lankester in a letter in <i>Nature</i>, 21st March, 1912, dissented
from the mode of treatment of this point by Sir Archdall Reid and presumably
also by Dr. Dixey in the words “It is not, I think, permissible to say that the
normal characters which arise in response to normal conditions are with
equal fitness to be described as ‘acquired.’” As to what is a normal
character and what are normal conditions there may be much reason for
difference of opinion, but I have said enough of this discussion to show that
the terms “acquired” and “character” would afford a biological Pascal
some such food for criticism as did the term “probable” in his <i>Provincial
Letters</i>. The less these two terms are employed the less misunderstanding
there will be of certain problems.</p>

<p>It has been held that “discussing words is often indescribably tiresome,
but it is better than misunderstanding them,” which is most true.</p></div>

The twin metaphor here chosen for the name of a complex natural
process should be cleared a little of a certain obscurity of meaning. A mould
is familiar to all in domestic and industrial matters, but there are two sides
to the metaphorical conception. A plastic object may be moulded by the
hand of man as in his ruder, but more laborious days, or it may be pressed into
an artificial mould that he has made by means of his hands and tools. One
of these we know in the rude pottery made by prehistoric man and the vessel
of the potter described by Jeremiah the prophet. We know also those
machine-made moulds, so accurate as to be fitted for the coinage of a nation
and able to puzzle a clever coiner who tries to copy them. We know the
rough hewing of the stone by the sculptor which follows his moulding of the
clay. And in Sacred Writ we read of a double process when the Hebrews
not content with their object of worship took the golden ear-rings of their
women and Aaron “received them at their hand and fashioned it with a
graving tool, after he had made it a <i>molten calf</i>.” But as no conception of a
mould in biological matters, which connotes the rigid accuracy of the coiner’s
mould, can represent the truth, the rougher and freer meaning of the term
is here employed. A similar double meaning is implicit in the metaphor
of the sieve, considered as a human utensil. I believe we owe this idea of a
sieve to Professor Thomson, but am not sure on this point. But I have not
been able to find any definition as to the way in which the sieve of natural
selection is held to act. A sieve is of course for sifting substances, and the
size of the mesh is adapted by us for the purpose we have in view. We may
want a sieve to hold back for us the fit or good and allow the unfit or bad to
pass through, for example wheat and chaff, or we may employ it to separate
sand for our purposes from fine gravel. The former is of course the most
common of the purposes for which a sieve is used. So here the comparison
of personal selection with the action of a sieve agrees with this aspect of a
sieve, the fit being retained and the unfit allowed to pass through, thus agreeing
with that view of Spencer’s of the survival of the fittest which is held by
most authorities to be more accurate than Darwin’s Natural Selection.</p></div>

I may remark that Darwin seems at an earlier date to have made a
very curious suggestion in this connection, for Hartmann, in his work on
Anthropoid Apes, p.&nbsp;99, quotes him as saying: “We should, however, bear
in mind that the attitude of an animal may perhaps be in part determined
by the direction of the hair; and not the direction of the hair by the attitude,”
a notion so obviously untenable that it does not appear in the second edition
of <i>The Descent of Man</i>, 1896.</p></div>

It is not sufficiently noticed by some writers how important is Professor
Keith’s teaching as to the maintenance of the arch by muscular action
rather than ligamentous union. And it is a very practical matter from my own
point of view in connection with the prevention of flat-foot in the young. If
indeed the poor deformed feet of the sufferers can only be corrected by
attention to the lowly-organised ligaments, and the muscles will not avail,
I can but add “God help them!”</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
